"This regional collaborative proposes an evidence-based system for increasing STEM and CTE teacher preparation to meet the in-demand jobs, and address shortages in the field of education. ","STEM, CTE and related teacher demand for K-12, and community colleges. The project activities and outcomes fill a need that is currently not addressed with a Deputy Sector Navigator for Education. ","CCSF and Cabrillo College will partner on leadership to work across the Bay Region community colleges with a framework to promote teaching as a profession, support on ramps to STEM and CTE K12, and community college teaching. Furthermore, no career pathway in the state will succeed without a robust teacher workforce.","Connecting adults to courses leading to teacher certification and degrees; Develop and broadly publicize industry-informed career pathways that prepare students for jobs needed within the regional labor market.","California is in the midst of a well-documented severe teacher shortage; additionally, most community colleges and school districts are experiencing a shortage of CTE teachers. This project will engage with strategies to ""grow your own"" CTE faculty. This regional collaborative builds on the statewide CCCCO supported Teacher Preparation Pipeline STEM/CTE Collaborative of ten community colleges, including CCSF and Cabrillo College in the Bay Area. This project will implement the proven approaches from the statewide pilot to focus on the Bay Region. Other regions are proposing similar projects with their regional SWP funds."
"The proposal would create a dynamic entrepreneurial certificate program in partnership with other entrepreneurial organizations and three partner colleges. According to the Northern California Small Business Development Center, small business start-ups in the greater Sacramento area, and especially Placer County, are expected to increase 10-22% for the 5-year period 2014-2019. Additionally, existing small businesses are projected to expand, and thus their need for qualified employees, during the same period by approximately 15%. Further, according to Burning-Glass labor market studies, the demand for students with small business management skills will increase 18% in Placer County in the next 2-3 years.  During that same period, minority businesses are expected to increase 18% in Placer County. This proposal will prepare students for these business development opportunities.","Nearly every community college in California provides coursework or program offerings to support entrepreneurs and small business owners. However, there are potential gaps or opportunities to supplement curricular offerings for these individuals
Based on research conducted for this report, the following action steps are recommended for California Community Colleges: • Work with Business and Entrepreneurship Centers (BEC) to facilitate creation of industry cluster-based entrepreneurial networks • Develop entrepreneurship programs based on regional industries • Adapt curriculum and course offerings to reflect both small business ownership and entrepreneurs • Offer specialized entrepreneurial coursework • Course offerings should include local, state, and national policy regarding entrepreneurial efforts.
","Doing What Matters identifies small business is one of the top sector priorities http://doingwhatmatters.cccco.edu/. Small business is also one of the three priority sectors in the Greater Sacramento Region.
Data on employment opportunities do not adequately address small business and entrepreneurship because entrepreneurs are creating jobs, not applying for jobs. Studies on Home-Based Businesses for the Sacramento Region and the Far North Region were produced by the Centers of Excellence of the California Community Colleges (Far North Report) and Economic and Workforce Development office of the California Community College as part of Doing What Matters for Jobs and the Economy. Home-based businesses are defined as employing four or fewer workers. In the Sacramento Region there are 10,430 home-based businesses and one out of three of these businesses earns revenues higher than $500,000 annually. These home-based businesses are about 10.5% of all businesses in the area and 16% of the microbusiness. In the Far North Region, there are 6,940 home based businesses and nearly 30% of these businesses earn revenues higher than $500,000 annually. There are nearly 7,000 home-based businesses in the Fa North economy, which represents about 12% of all businesses and 18% of micro-businesses in the area.   

According to the Centers of Excellence study, to address the skills gap in the Far North Region, local community colleges can implement the following: • Integrate workplace skill training into existing career and technical education (CTE) programs and/or add workplace skill courses to CTE programs as a requirement or prerequisite. • Strengthen partnerships with local businesses to increase the number of internships or job training opportunities to students. Work experience gives students an edge in the hiring process by giving them the experience needed to demonstrate technical skills. It also gives students a chance to practice and apply soft skills learned in the classroom in the work environment. • Create and promote a mechanism that connects community college graduates with local small businesses that have open positions, such as a job board, career fairs, or direct announcements targeting specific industry groups. • Offer and promote free or low-cost workshops or training seminars for the incumbent workforce to raise skills of ‘poor performers’ and those interested in advancing in their careers. Topics of most interest to local employers include: accounting/QuickBooks, social media/online ecommerce, and business plan development. Other workshops of interest include: customer service, basic computer applications (MS Word, Excel & Outlook), leadership and supervisory skills, and human resource management

The proposed entrepreneurship program will offer a 21-unit interdisciplinary degree with a focus on social entrepreneurship requiring units from the entrepreneur's interest areas or discipline. A 9-unit skills certificate will provide students practical skills to establish a small business and provides a stackable certificate should the student decide to acquire further entrepreneurial skills and knowledge. This certificate provides foundational business skills for entrepreneurs in any discipline---from photographers, music artists, fashion designers, childcare providers, personal trainers, agriculture, nutritionists to contractors in construction, the educational path is flexible and customizable to fit students’ needs.
This new entrepreneurship program provides students with classroom learning mixed with apprenticeships and internships to help them launch new ventures. The program offers a robust core of business classes for those interested in starting a business with an opportunity to focus on managing capital. We also want students leaving this program to have a solid understanding of accounting practices for their enterprise.
An exciting component of this new program includes courses to help students identify and design sustainable, socially-minded business opportunities. It is our goal to have students leave this program with an understanding

"Maker spaces add value to career and technical education programs by providing students a venue to image, create, experiment, and connect what they’ve been learning in the classroom to tangible business products and ideas.  These formative learning labs open the doors to personalized and authentic learning. With access to technology to create and make, students develop enhanced problem solving skills, self-direction, design skills, mechanical aptitude, and entrepreneurial skills.  In the first year, the Strong Workforce Program funds will be used to support the development of a maker space at each Los Rios college.","Based on research conducted by Valley Vision and the Northern California Center of Excellence, local employers in the manufacturing/processing sector prefer to hire graduates with practical knowledge and hands-on experience.  While theory is essential, the best hires are those with mechanical aptitude and design/production skills.  ","This proposal meets the needs of the region's labor market by better preparing students for careers in the advanced manufacturing sector.  Students that have an opportunity to learn design thinking through practical, hands-on learning are better equipped for the evolving nature of the manufacturing sector.","By providing a venue to incorporate theory with hands-on learning, students will gain skills that will better prepare them for the workforce, such as problem solving, self-direction, mechanical aptitude, and process/flow models.","Maker spaces improve the delivery of instruction in a variety of CTE programs (design technology, engineering, welding, entrepreneurship, business management, etc.).  This closely aligns to the region’s goal to ‘align college programs with regional and industry needs and provide support of CTE programs.’"
"There is a shortage of specialty Registered Nurses as the priority workforce need. Specialty nurses does exist and prioritized seven areas, with hiring projections over the next year as follows: Critical Care: 2,320; Emergency: 1,392; Perioperative: 1,072; Labor & Delivery: 864; Neonatal ICU: 688; Case Manager, Care Coordinator and Mental Health: growing. ","This proposal will address the projected shortage of specialty Registered Nurses as the priority workforce need.","Yes, with the information from a statewide and local needs assessment employers are sharing the need for these specialty nurses in the industry. ","Yes, per the The California Hospital Association (CHA) and Hospital Association of Southern California (HASC) they have identified the shortage of specialty Registered Nurses as the priority workforce need.","Health is a priority in the SCCRC region and will continue to remain a priority. With the increase age of the nurse and those projected to retire, there will be a need for specialized trained nurses to fill this gap and service the safety net. "
"The goal of this project is to improve the quantity and quality of clinical placement sites for all of the health programs in the region. It is proposed that the region hire a regional clinical placement developer who can assist the healthcare programs in the region with identifying and acquiring clinical sites for student placements. Finding clinical placements is a time intensive job for the faculty and assistance from someone working on a regional level with all of the healthcare facilities would be beneficial.  In addition, industry is asking us to increase our student enrollment in particular healthcare programs which would be an added burden on the faculty already trying to do this job.   We cannot increase student enrollment in health care programs unless we have the additional clinical spaces for our students.  The priority for the regional clinical placement coordinator will be to work regionally with our industry partners to obtain these additional placements.","This proposal addresses the barrier of not having clinical placements when we want to increase enrollment in certain health programs. ","In healthcare there is a need to increase enrollments in several health programs across the North Region.  The largest barrier to increasing enrollment is the lack of clinical placements and the amount of effort it takes by the program coordinator to acquire commitments from clinical sites for placements.  By doing this on a regional basis we can have one person developing relationships with industry for each of the colleges and acquiring clinical placements.  In particular, there is currently a need for more medical assistants.  We cannot increase the number of students in our medical assisting programs unless we have the clinical sites to place the students.  The clinical placement developer will work on obtaining these sites.  ","The clinical placement developer will work with the identified health programs in the region to acquire commitments for clinical placements from our industry partners.","The Health DSN convened a regional meeting in June 2016 that included Deans and Vice Presidents of Instruction.  The purpose of the meeting was to review the Labor Market Info developed by the COE in their Health Cluster Report and develop strategies to meet the labor market needs.

"The purpose of this project is to develop a Physical Therapy Assistant program available for the North Far North area of California.  This program will offer an Associate Degree in Science.  Physical Therapy Assistants (PTAs) are licensed health care providers who provide physical therapy services under the supervision of a Physical Therapist. PTAs work in a variety of settings such as skilled nursing facilities, hospitals, outpatient therapy practices, home health, and specialty settings. Upon completion of the program, students will be prepared for careers as a Physical Therapy Assistant and will be eligible to apply for licensure through the Physical Therapy Board of California.
The closest Physical Therapy Assistant program is at Sacramento City College.  
Physical Therapy facilities in the North Far North report difficulty in recruiting for Physical Therapy Assistants.  Although there are potential employees who are interested, it is either difficult to get to an approved program due to distance and length of program, or that those who do attend find employment in the Sacramento area and do not apply for the rural area positions that are open.
The Shasta College Community Education Department just completed their first Physical Therapy Aide class. There was overwhelming interest from the community. The class was prepared by Jim Earle, owning partner of North State Physical Therapy.  Mr. Earle is very interested in developing a Physical Therapy Assistant program with Shasta College.  According to his colleagues in the field, it is difficult to find qualified PTAs in the area. Often practices must hire and train their own PTAs, which is time consuming. The general feedback from the physical therapy community is that it would be supportive of a PTA program offered by Shasta College with other North Far North colleges for the purpose of serving this community’s needs.
Mendocino College has been approached by a network of five (5) acute care hospitals to provide a Physical Therapy Assistant program to meet their needs for recruitment/employment of Physical Therapy Assistants. 
The plan is to provide didactic instruction through an online format with the participating colleges utilizing the same CCCCO approved curriculum and then partner with local healthcare physical therapy facilities for the clinical component.  
Student enrollment would be based on enrolling only one cohort of students annually.  The intention is to balance the enrollment with the employment need at the participating employers and the ability of graduates to find employment locally.  Shasta College anticipates enrolling an annual cohort of 15 students.  Mendocino will also plan to enroll a cohort of 15 – 20 depending on the network hospital employment needs.
Very much like traditional nursing training, this program will establish clinical affiliation agreements with the local industry healthcare employers to provide the clinical component of training.  The physical therapy industry will partner with the colleges by offering their facilities and designated staff for the clinical training portion of the physical therapy program.  Jim Earle, MPT, the physical therapist who developed the physical therapy aide program for Shasta College Community Education, has agreed to partner with Shasta College to develop the physical therapy assistant program as well as provide a clinical setting for the clinical training portion of the program. He is confident that additional physical therapy offices will partner as well.  Physical therapists see the partnership as a means to fulfill a community need as well as an opportunity for them to recruit physical therapy assistants. 
Our healthcare industry partners will be our advisors on the current issues and trends affecting Physical Therapy Assistants.  These industry partners will provide clinical placements; provide preceptor staff members to mentor the student interns and hire graduates.   In addition, they will serve on the Advisory Committees and co-sponsor activities that will promote career opportunities in our Career Pathways efforts with local High School partners.

Mendocino College has been approached by a five (5) hospital system requesting that the college provide a Physical Therapy Assistant program that would provide training in their facilities and be an employment pool for their physical therapy employment needs.","According to the Physical Therapy Assistants Research Brief, Northern California (2013) in the Northern California region the physical therapy assistant occupation is projected to grow by 18 percent through 2017. In addition, it is estimated that employers will need to replace approximately 35 workers over the period due to retirements and those leaving the field for other reasons. With both growth and replacements considered, this could result in 23 open positions annually","The colleges involved in this project are proposing to provide a Physical Therapy Assistant Associate Degree program for students in the North Far North region partnering with health care facilities who are in need of PTAs.  The colleges will develop and provide the course content, establish accreditation with the appropriate regulatory agencies. The physical therapy employers will provide the clinical facilities and experiences the students will need to complete the program.  This program will provide the necessary skills for local residents to be employed as Physical Therapy 
Assistants in the local areas in which they are trained.  By training in the facilities in their local areas, we will provide the local healthcare employers with access to needed applicants for open positions.  Students will be able to be trained without having to relocate.
This program will allow local residents to complete an Associate Degree in Physical Therapy Assistant and be eligible to apply for licensure as an Physical Therapy Assistant.  The program will have a goal of having a completion rate of 80%. ","This program will provide another career pathway for residents of our communities.  Health is one of the largest growing industries in the Far North area and as such there is an emphasis on developing training programs that will allow opportunities for our residents to increase their wage opportunities (NORTEC Regional Labor Market Profile and Industry/Sector Analysis Draft, August, 2016).  In addition, health is one of the sectors that is being addressed in our Career Pathways Trust Grant with our local High Schools.  "
"The NFN Colleges see great value in collaborating on the creation and alignment of curriculum within the Advanced Manufacturing sector. The colleges will focus their efforts in three pathways, 1) Manufacturing Process Design and Development, 2) Production, and 3) Maintenance, Installation, & Repair (Automation Technician). Through regional coordination, faculty development, marketing, and sharing of resources the participating colleges believe they can achieve greater things as a collaborative than they would going it alone. This proposal builds on work completed under the NFNRC CTE EF project for Advanced Manufacturing, Shasta College IDRC Advance Manufacturing, Prop 39, and other local and regional funding efforts. The NFN Advanced Manufacturing Network will include: 1) the development and alignment of new curriculum in Design Thinking, Digital Fabrication, Workforce Readiness, Entrepreneurship and Maintenance, Installation & Repair, and Automation Technician in stackable certificates; 2) regional faculty professional development, for both college and dual enrollment instructors; 3) regional coordination of course/program scheduling and promotion; and 4) a regional coordination for creating opportunities to deliver instruction via Apprenticeship-Related Technical Instruction, internships, concurrent enrollment, dual enrollment, intersession, compressed schedule, and live virtual will be explored with high school and industry partners. ","Mass customization, globalization and rapid technology advances have required NFN employers to demand workers with more advanced skills such as using software to design three-dimensional parts, developing and testing prototypes, operating and maintaining computerized machinery and tools, and performing complex tasks and calculations to improve manufacturing processes. These jobs also require critical thinking, problem solving, communication, collaboration, creativity, and innovation.  Advanced manufacturing employers are in urgent need of a workforce with all of these skills.  The advanced manufacturing industry is a critical part of a healthy economy.  Manufacturing has a larger multiplier effect than any other major economic activity.  Each $1 spent in manufacturing generates $1.35 in additional economic activity.  On average, one new manufacturing job creates 1.6 additional jobs in local service businesses. Northern California region’s most important asset is its workforce. Having workers who can effectively use current technology and develop and use future technologies will ensure the region remains competitive and supportive of a healthy quality of life. The purpose of this workforce initiative, created by the NFN Advanced Manufacturing Network, is to develop a regional workforce system that creates jobs that support a high performance economy and educates and trains the workforce required by a high performance economy.","More than 90 percent of the region’s employers are small (less than 50 employees) and many can be classified as micro-businesses (1-4 employees).  Manufacturing companies are boutique and niche industries, as mass production is most often shipped out of the country.  Employees must possess a diversified skill set that improves the competitive edge of a business.  This includes strong technical skills, such as CNC, but also related skills including Computer Aided Drafting, Entrepreneurial and Design Thinking, and Project Management.  This proposal meets the needs of the regional labor market by developing courses and preparing the future workforce for current and future advanced manufacturing occupations, and strengthens the competitiveness of companies that are small and micro-sized by providing highly skilled workers with a demonstrated broad and complex portfolio of advanced manufacturing skill sets.","NFN Colleges will be regional advanced manufacturing economic assets, bringing together companies, community colleges and professional organizations to develop the latest manufacturing curricula and training programs.  The NFN Advance Manufacturing Network Initiative will serve regional employers by strengthening the pipeline of skilled workers for hire, and increase availability for incumbent worker training to advance skills through stackable, portable certificates. The NFN Colleges want to ensure that people in the state have the skills necessary to compete and thrive in today’s economic marketplace. They also want to ensure that current and future workers develop the skills necessary to create and use the technology that maintains the region’s competitiveness. The objective is to create a portable, regional endorsement of skill certifications that support systems based on state or national industry skill standards. According to the National School to Work Office, a skill standard specifies the knowledge and competencies required to perform successfully in the workplace. Standards are being developed along a skill continuum ranging from 1) general work readiness skills and 2) core skills or knowledge for an industry to 3) skills common to an occupational cluster, and 4) specific occupational skills. Standards may cover basic and advanced academic competencies, employability competencies, and technical competencies. Development of these standards is tied to efforts to certify students' and workers' skills. The NFN Advance Manufacturing Network Initiative is a long-term regional commitment to develop an excellent, front-line workforce based on the use of skill standards. The NFN Advance Manufacturing Network will ensure that a worker’s skills sanctioned in one region are recognized in all NFN Community Colleges. By recognizing and validating skills regardless of where they are acquired, The NFN Advance Manufacturing Network Initiative fosters lifelong learning critical to the region’s competitiveness and to the employability of the region’s workers.","Improved performance will be accomplished by increased support of: 1) Workforce readiness skills through assessment and soft skill advising coupled with career advising for economic sustainability; 2) Core skills or knowledge for an industry; 3) Skills common to an occupational cluster and; 4) Specific occupational skills. Instructional Standards will cover basic and advanced academic competencies, employability competencies, and technical competencies. Development of these high performance skill standards is tied to efforts to certify students’ and worker’s skills. The programs will issue skill competencies and their support systems will meet the following six critical quality indicators:  1) Industry-Validated Competency Based Standards; 2) Industry-Recognized Credentials; 3) performance Assessment Strategies and Criteria; 4) Continues Stakeholder endorsement and Involvement; 5) A System of Quality Improvement; and 6) Career Development Planning. The NFN Advance Manufacturing Network Initiative will strengthen and support instruction by providing professional development opportunities to community college faculty and their high school teacher partners. Professional development will include workshops and industry externships to maintain currency in technical knowledge and skills, and to strengthen linkages with business and industry partners. The NFN Advance Manufacturing Network Initiative will focus on regional coordination of course/program scheduling and promotion. In addition, the partner community colleges, in coordination with Grow Manufacturing Initiative (GMI) will work to expand and replicate the Manufacturing Expo to other areas within the North/Far North Region.  There is also a commitment to the regional coordination of apprenticeship-related technical instruction, and internships.  Live-virtual instructional opportunities will be explored with high school and industry partners.  The NFN Advance Manufacturing Network Initiative will strengthen the work-based learning experience placement process by partnering with the Foundation for California Community Colleges’ Career Catalyst program (http://foundationccc.org/What-We-Do/Workforce-Development/Workforce-Services).  Finally, the NFN Advance Manufacturing Network Initiative will work in collaboration with the Deputy Sector Navigators in the region to identify employer partners and in placing students in work-based learning experiences. The NFN Advance Manufacturing Network Initiative will work with employers to provide a wage match for securing a project-supported student intern. The Career Catalyst program will conduct post-internship surveys with employers to assess satisfaction on the experience. In partnership with Society for Manufacturing Engineers, facilitate development and expansion of student chapters, industry tours, internships, and externships."
"EVs and hybrids require a unique skill set in the job market. This project will ensure that our automotive labs keep pace with the growing EV market and all students receive instruction on these new vehicle systems. This proposal is to update our region's college automotive labs for instruction on electric vehicle (EV) and hybrid vehicle systems by acquiring one vehicle (plug-in EV or hybrid vehicle) per college per year, along with the necessary scan/diagnostic tools and manufacturer online information subscriptions. The project also funds professional development for faculty to become proficient on these new systems. 
Most of our 9 automotive programs are not currently equipped with electric vehicles. A few have hybrids but they are out-of-date. Over the past year and a half, faculty across the region have collaborated to develop shared course curricula and obtain EV/hybrid professional development. Equipping the labs will be the final step needed to incorporate EV instruction into the curriculum of all our automotive programs. Funding in the amount of $495,500 per year for 2 years (totaling $991,000) is requested for the 9 college programs. ","LMI & SUPPLY: 462 automotive service technicians will be needed each year to fill new positions between 2015 and 2020, totaling 2,310 over the five-year period, according to LMI reports from the Centers of Excellence.  All of these technicians will need specialized skills to work on EV and hybrid vehicles. Yet, of the 9 automotive programs in our region, only 3 are equipped to provide plug-in EV training. Some provide hybrid training on old models. Labs having the necessary equipment to teach the emerging automotive technologies are needed.","LABOR MARKET GAPS: (1) Current 3-year average degree and certificate awards for automotive service technician students in our region total 190 annually (compared to 462 automotive technicians needed annually); (2) most of the students in our automotive programs do not receive the skills they need for EV & hybrid vehicles due to lack of course availability; and (3) most of our programs do not have the necessary equipment - including vehicles, scan, and diagnostic tools - to implement EV & hybrid instruction. Updating the region's automotive labs for EV and hybrid instruction will enable all our programs to provide skill training that increases the competitiveness of our graduates in the labor market.","This proposal is to acquire the vehicles, scan/diagnostic tools, and additional professional development needed by each college to ensure that labs are up-to-date and effective instruction is provided on these modern vehicle systems. By funding this request, students will receive a full set of skills for today's automotive market and help programs convey a positive, high-tech message about automotive careers. Over the next two years, the project will occur in concert with DSN funded activities designed to update the image of automotive occupations and intensify recruitment efforts. Students, parents, and counselors will receive professional materials presenting a high-tech image and essential career pathway information.  Working with feeder high school programs, recruitment events are currently being planned.  More effective recruitment will result in increased enrollment in our programs, followed by higher job placements to fill the regional gap. 
High school teachers have been a part of this collaborative work among faculty. By establishing program connections at the high school level, students will have a clearer pathway to the college programs defined, which will also support college recruiting goals.","Strong Workforce legislation states that future funding will depend on: CTE FTES, job openings, and improvements in workforce metrics beyond the first year.  This project will address all three by increasing FTES through program modernization tied to stronger recruitment, filling job openings by producing higher skilled job-competitive graduates, and preparing students to handle a broader set of responsibilities, resulting in higher wages.
The transportation sector is an important sector for economic growth in our region. Clean transportation was the hottest sector for venture capital investment in California, bringing in $3.4 billion in 2015. Zero emission vehicle registrations increased by 244 percent between 2012 and 2014, driven by a 115 percent increase in all-electric vehicles and a 550 percent increase in plug-in hybrid vehicles. Riverside–San Bernardino–Ontario ranks fifth in the State for the number of clean vehicle rebates, indicating that a large number of EVs are operating in our region. The automotive industry needs highly qualified technicians in larger numbers to continue its economic contribution to our region. This project will help our CTE programs meet that need."
"With the rapid technology shift in Advanced manufacturing and other industries, there is a demand for skilled Mechatronics Technicians.  Generally there are only a few required at each industry site so developing training programs for incumbent workers is a challenge.  There is a need to get a pathway established for entry-level workers as well.  There is need to establish a program to include workers from all sizes of industry to achieve economies of scale to insure we are providing these skills at all levels- entry to advanced, as requested by industry.
There were limited facilities in the region that have the equipment and facilities to provide a full curriculum for Mechatronic Technicians.  
","Aligns with the Mechatronics Technician standards developed by the California Advanced Manufacturing Collaborative.

Develops a regional Learn and Earn program that will include small to large industry partners to meet their needs and establish a succession plan.  It will provide training to entry-level employees in the skills industry needed to seek entry into this field.  This would then be potentially recognized as an industry recognized certificate.
","This proposal is designed to meet the very rapid advancement of mechatronic skills gap in the industry sectors listed.  There have been several industry skill panel convenings in the region.  The need for skilled mechatronic workers is one of the most requested.","It will  increase the enrollment at the regional colleges that are providing credit-based programs in these areas. 
Currently, there are limited or no options for industry to obtain training for their incumbent workers.  Through a regional center, economies of scale can be achieved by bundling training that will allow large and small employers to place employees in the pathway and meet the need for a skilled workforce in these three crafts.  Working with industry, a flexible schedule can be developed and implemented to meet established goals.

Other regional colleges can participate in this pathway and provide some of the instruction required if a regional apprenticeship/Learn & Earn Mechatronic program is started.  See below

This would then be potentially recognized as an industry recognized certificate.

This aligns will with WIOA, and Adult Education's push for industry recognized certificates and apprenticeship programs
","This proposal addresses a priority in multiple industry sectors in the region by allowing industries from various sizes to participate in development of their workforce and obtain training for new and existing workers to meet requirements for the ever changing work environment."
"With the rapid  technology shift in Advanced  Manufacturing and other industries, there is a demand for  skilled welders who can rapidly be brought on the job and/or advanced. There is a need to get a not-for-credit ACE pathway established for entry-level workers that will lead to credit-based programs.  There is a need to establish a program to include workers from all sizes of industry to achieve  economies of scale to insure  we are providing these  skills at all levels- entry to advanced, being  as requested by industry. ","Provides industry requested welding skills to assist new  and incumbent workers so they can secure and advance in their careers and provides the pathway to start their certificates and degrees. Many credit programs are impacted and cannot provide rapid short-term welding related training.   This program will begin as a not-for-credit ACE program that will be converted to noncredit or credit program by the end of the funding stream.  It will provide entry-level employees with the skills industry requires to seek entry into this field. This training will align with an industry recognized certificate.","This proposal is designed to meet the very rapid advancement of the skills gap in
the industry sectors listed. There have been several industry skill panel convenings in the region. The need for skilled welders is one of the most requested.
","It will potentially increase the enrollment at the regional colleges that are providing credit­ based programs in these areas. Currently, there are limited or no options for industry to obtain training for their incumbent workers.  Through a regional center, economies of scale can be achieved by bundling training that will allow large and small employers to place employees in the pathway and meet the need for a skilled workforce in these three crafts. Working with industry, a flexible schedule can be developed and implemented to meet established goals. ","This proposal addresses a priority in multiple industry sectors in the region to meet the skills required for rapidly changing industries in these sectors.  "
"Currently, each educational entity in the region manages and facilitates advisories to support their individual CTE programs. The demand for business partner engagement far exceeds the available supply of quality business partners. Limited resources (including time, money, and personnel) impact regional business partners and make it difficult to meet the growing demand in the region. 

The project will develop regional and sub-regional advisory committee(s) that will serve both 
community colleges and K-12 feeder schools. The project will collaborate with the IEEP to convene and facilitate advisory meetings and strengthen industry-education relationships.

The project will also promote concurrent curriculum revisions (when needed) and help ensure that programs accurately predict skill requirements to develop a workforce that will meet the future needs of industry.","A Career and Technical Education (CTE) advisory committee is a group of business and industry experts selected by local educators and administrators to serve in an advisory capacity to the CTE program. The purpose of an advisory committee is to advise instructors and administrators with respect to the development and maintenance of quality career and technical programs. Properly functioning advisory committees help schools ensure that programs reflect the changing needs of students, business and industry, and community.

Advisory meetings meet the following needs/requirements of educational institutions across the region:
• provide an opportunity for discussion among people in education, business and industry to focus on how to improve Career and Technical Education (CTE) and make the most of the community resources that are available
• strive to improve the relationships between the school, business and industry
• provide expertise to the program by reviewing curriculum, equipment, facilities, budget, student competencies, and student placement in related occupations
• are required according to California Education Code 52302.2, Perkins, Title 5: 11504, and the Counsel on Occupational Education (COE)

Currently, each educational entity in the IE/Desert region manages and facilitates advisories to support their individual CTE programs.  The demand for business partner engagement far exceeds the available supply of quality business partners.  Limited resources (including time, money, and personnel) impact regional business partners and make it difficult to meet the growing demand in the region. 

The gap this work group has identified is the lack of a regional advisory process that would streamline and standardize the information and resources necessary to support regional CTE programs effectively and efficiently.  Regional advisories would identify gaps in training, update the region's offerings and/or curriculum to remain current with industry, and connect industry to educational institutions and the students they serve.","Implementing a successful regional/sub-regional CTE Advisory program will help the community colleges and K12 Districts to be more actively engaged with our business and industry partners. This will result in education being more informed of the needs and expectations of business, as well as changing trends related to workforce demands and hiring practices. In addition, we can design curriculum and instruction to be better aligned with the regional labor market.","We believe that the students of our region would be better served by utilizing regional or sub-regional advisory committee(s) that would serve both Community Colleges and K-12 feeder schools.  In several of the SWP workgroup sessions it was noted that when Community Colleges modify their curriculum to meet the changing needs of the industry in their communities.  In turn, those changes often impact the articulation requirements of feeder schools.  This plan includes employment of a third-party organization to convene and facilitate advisory groups that can serve multiple institutions, promoting concurrent curriculum revisions (when needed), strengthening industry-education relationships, and help insure that programs accurately predict skill requirements to develop a workforce that will meet the future needs of industry.

The meetings will satisfy the high quality indicators for CTE including:

"The creation of the Incubator/Makerspace at select colleges will enable colleges to pull from a new set of students according to Van Ton-Quinlivan. These spaces will be able to reach out to new students that may not have considered attending community colleges previously, thus increasing enrollments in CTE programs. Additionally, they will be exposed to any number of new courses, which will be up to the colleges themselves as to what they introduce in their incubators and Makerspaces. For example, at Crafton Hills College, new noncredit certificates are being created to draw students into the incubator and provide a support structure for them. This will also create a pathway for them to continue on to the credit classes at the college if they so choose. Additionally, by offering these classes as noncredit any student currently at the college can add this certificate to their major without it affecting financial aid. For example a photography student may want to start their own business after graduation. With the entrepreneurship certificate, they will be more prepared, with the incubator, they have a place to increase their chances of success as well. By being around so many other entrepreneurs, they will be networking and learning from one another.  So we will increase enrollments by offering these noncredit or credit classes at the incubator. One of the requirements could be that they take these classes. This would be up to each college. 

With respect to the Makerspaces, these will be incredible spaces to help students explore new career pathways as well as to allow our faculty to research new programs or ways to incorporate more tech based learning into their current programs. How do you help students learn math through hands on exercise in the Makerspace? In Pasadena they are already doing this. Students that go through their basic skills Makerspace class increase their level by 2 levels after the class because they are creating and building, not just doing arithmetic from a book. They are learning to read and follow those instructions. They learn to use a ruler to accurately measure. The makerspace will create a funnel for so many more students to enter CTE fields of study. Noncredit classes can be created to get students started on the pathway and then transfer to the credit classes afterwards. This will directly increase the number of students in CTE. Credit classes can be created as well. And while the curriculum is waiting approval from the Chancellor's office colleges can offer community education classes which can help to support the Makerspace and make it financially viable.

I have selected the major industry sectors for these spaces, small business, advanced manufacturing, and  ICT/Digital Media. However, colleges can choose what pathways they want to create the makerspace for and what programs they want to support. The possibilities are vast and limited only by the time the faculty have to create new programs. 

The makerspaces and incubators also created spaces for faculty from various disciplines to interact with one another and learn how to incorporate entrepreneurship or advanced manufacturing into their own classes. 

Additionally, these spaces will get the business industry involved more with the colleges and therefore create an opportunity for internships for our students and also new businesses that can come onto those colleges advisory boards. It helps our colleges to keep from working in silos and start working with our communities that we serve.","Only 66% of new businesses survive their first year, and only 50% survive at least five years thereafter. Business incubators and makerspaces are critical in helping new businesses survive because they help entrepreneurs stay on track through mentoring and leadership development. This proposal is for a 3-year program designed to give students the knowledge and tools needed to help start and grow their businesses. It has been expressed by community colleges across the region that there is a need for business incubators and makerspaces that are easily accessible to students studying entrepreneurship and technology. There is a gap in entrepreneurial and technology studies in which students do not have a dedicated location to explore entrepreneurship or the tools to develop product prototypes. ","This proposal would allow each region to have a makerspace and incubator available to students studying entrepreneurship and technology. In addition, through the success of this program. The makerspace model creates a pathway for students into CTE fields while also reaching nontraditional students that may be apprehensive to attend college such as working adults. This model will also allow access to high school and middle school students creating a pathway from middle school to the community college and on.","The establishment of business incubators and makerspaces in San Bernardino and Riverside Counties is proposed to eliminate the gap of not having locations for students to explore entrepreneurship and apply the skills they learn in technology. These locations will be easily accessible to students attending Community Colleges, in addition to being open to High School students interested in entrepreneurship and technology pathways. Both the incubators and makerspaces will offer a place for students to collaborate and share ideas, as well as serve as additional classroom space.","This proposal addresses three of our priority sectors; small business/entrepreneurship, advanced manufacturing, and ICT/Digital Media. Each of these areas creates a high wage and high demand occupation for our students. By creating these spaces we will e able to address the needs of industry and also help our community to attain high wage jobs."
"The purpose of this request is to conduct a comprehensive feasibility study for a regional tractor-trailer operator certificate program that could be offered at multiple colleges within Region 9.  The feasibility study would include identifying industry partners, forming an ad hoc advisory council specific to this industry to guide the process, an in depth labor market analysis, a comprehensive cost analysis - including equipment, facility rental, insurance, curriculum development, and framework options for potential implementation across the region.
At the request of the region, heavy equipment operator will also be explored as time and funding permits. 
","Heavy and tractor-trailer truck driver is defined as a tractor-trailer combination or a truck with a capacity of at least 26,000 pounds gross vehicle weight (GVW).  This occupation generally requires a commercial driver’s license and/or additional certifications dependent upon load.  As identified by the Centers of Excellence information, truck driving spans numerous industry occupational codes and sectors.  Further, 30.8% of 2016 jobs in this area belong to individuals between the ages of 45 and 54 years old, and 18.7% belong to those between the ages of 55 and 64 years old.  This demonstrates a unique opportunity for the region to meet a projected growth in labor market demand as the current tractor-trailer operator workforce retires.  Additionally, national education attainment for this occupation is greatest for those between the “less than a high school diploma” and “some college, but no degree,” categories, thus providing a unique opportunity for Region 9 community colleges to meet the need for a short-term certificate in this area.  Centers of Excellence data also show that the median hourly earnings for a Riverside – San Bernardino – Ontario, California tractor-trailer operator is $21.48, with a statewide median hourly earnings of $19.49.","The heavy and tractor-trailer trailer truck driver (SOC 53-3032) occupation continues to grow, especially within Region 9.  Centers of Excellence LMI demonstrate a 10.5% positive change in job growth within Region 9, and 8.3% growth statewide.  Within Region 9 alone, there is an anticipated 3,278 new job openings between 2015 and 2020.  This excludes replacement jobs for those leaving the workforce.  This proposal will assist in meeting the needs of the region's labor market by identifying the necessary requirements to implement region-wide programming in a traditionally underrepresented, yet high-demand, educational field within the California community college system. Fully understanding the opportunities and limitations of a tractor-trailer operator training program, and heavy equipment operator, will establish the groundwork necessary to potentially implement a program to meet this need in the following funding cycles. ","Currently, the statewide marketplace for occupational training in this area appears to belong primarily to for-profit and/or private driving schools.  Further, it appears that very few community colleges within the California Community College system offer commercial driving, bus driving, or tractor-trailer operator certificate programs.  This provides an exceptional opportunity for Region 9 to take the initial steps to meet the verified local and statewide demand for trained tractor-trailer and heavy-equipment operators through the offering of an industry recognized credential at an affordable cost to students.","This proposal falls within the Global Trade and Logistics sector, one of the priority and emerging sectors for Region 9.  As noted on the Inland Empire/Desert Regional Consortium website, the region now ranks 24th in the nation in export supported jobs, with a positive labor market trajectory.  
Further, the proposed study provides the opportunity to do ""more and better"" CTE programming by laying the initial foundation that can be used for future program development for any college within the region. "
"Develop and execute a collaborative, professional CTE marketing and outreach campaign for the Inland Empire/Desert Regional colleges. The project will target prospective students, employers, and community organizations.","Develop and sustain a meaningful marketing and outreach campaign targeted to parents and potential students. Whether a younger student is transitioning from high school to community college or an older student is transitioning between careers, knowing their educational options and where they could lead is what matters most to our customers.  However, clearly defined educational choices and guidance to support their decision-making is often lacking in the system.  The outreach and information priority for our region under this project will be to develop an effective informational piece for each sector describing occupation choices, what the educational requirements are for each, and several well-defined pathways presented a “career ladder” approach.  The career ladder map describes 1) how an education and training process builds from one level to the next, 2) where cross-over points exist within and between programs for students to gain specialization, and 3) where career-experienced students can enter and exit programs based on their level of skill or expertise needed for career advancement.","Marketing and outreach efforts will focus primarily on sectors and pathways with identified regional labor market gaps.","The project will develop a multi-pronged approach to marketing CTE programs regionally and will leverage regional efforts with statewide “projects in common” efforts related to branding and outreach to students and to employers. The statewide branding and outreach effort is already underway. The regional consortium will conduct research (phase 1) to gain a solid understanding of opportunities for developing a strategic approach and plan for communications within the four main stakeholder groups – students, colleges, third-party workforce development partners, and business and industry employers. Phase 1 will produce a comprehensive Communications Assessment, which will inform future phases of the regional marketing and outreach project.","Marketing and outreach was identified as a regionwide gap and a priority for funding during regional planning meetings."
"Community colleges that have nursing programs in the region would obtain funding for a Clinical Site Placement Coordinator.  The Clinical Site Placement Coordinators (CSPC) would play a multifaceted role in the region for the ongoing support for nursing programs.  Their key roles would include:  ensuring clinical placements are secured for nursing students through collaboration with colleges, universities, hospitals, clinics, community placements and long term care/skilled nursing facilities.  The CSPC would be instrumental in identifying specialty clinical areas that are available for student placement such as pediatrics, maternity and mental health.  Therefore, ensuring that educational institutions are able to recruit or remediate faculty for those specialty areas to meet the Board of Registered Nursing faculty requirements. The Placement Coordinator would also be responsible for exploring other potential clinical and community sites and ensuring affiliation agreements are current.  Furthermore, the CSPC would provide useful insights for ongoing policy implementation and development.  ","The Placement Coordinator would coordinate hospital and skilled nursing facility/long term care placements for our students and our regional partners.  They would ensure that there is no overlapping of students from different institutions on a single ward in the hospital.  They would be the direct liaison that the hospitals could contact if there are any concerns regarding placement-rotations of students.  The Placement Coordinator would also be responsible to exploring other potential clinical and community sites and ensuring affiliation agreements are current.

","The healthcare industry provides a viable option to help alleviate poverty in the region by offering jobs that pay livable wages for all levels of skills and education. Occupations at every skill and education level are key for the Inland Empire where only 27-28% of the population has earned some level of college degree and the majority of residents hold only a high school diploma.
Research compiled by the Centers of Excellence, the Sector Navigators, and Deputy Sector Navigator, resulted in one comprehensive labor market report for 2016. Centers of Excellence gathered and synthesized health care workforce data (10+ regional studies) key trends, gap analysis, sector growth potential and community college supply. Community college programs were identified for each occupation using the Taxonomy of Programs (TOP) coding system and are included in the report. The potential supply of students to the labor market for the related group of occupations and the number of students completing community college programs related to health care, was analyzed to determine if postsecondary institutions are supplying enough qualified students to meet workforce demand. Compilations resulted in projected 2015-2020 annual job openings for the occupations far exceeded the annual average student headcounts, annual average regional community college awards and the total annual average awards for education institutions outside of the California Community Colleges system. 
A recent statewide survey of hospitals conducted by California Hospital Association (CHA) found that population growth was one of the top 5 concerns related to the supply of the healthcare workforce. This is especially significant for the Inland Empire, a region with a rather low relative concentration of healthcare workers. According to Employment Development Department (EDD) data, the ratio of healthcare workers to residents in the combined San Bernardino-Riverside region is 1:34, which is much lower than those of Orange County (1:22), Los Angeles County (1:23) and San Diego County (1:24). 9 Some parts of the region are facing even greater shortages; for example, a study on the healthcare workforce in the Coachella Valley suggests that continued emphasis will be needed to assure there is a supply of well-trained and experienced nurses and other outpatient serving occupations to keep up with projected need
An expanded regional role of Clinical Site Placement Coordinator (CSPC) would ultimately facilitate the development and expansion of placement capacity, as the CSPC will fill a gap in the form of up-to-date local knowledge about the clinical areas. The CSPC will provide a much needed 'bridge' between the Community College, the student and the clinical area. The role would aim to support student learning in practice. Furthermore, useful insights for ongoing policy implementation and development, faculty recruitment and retention, are to be in the scope of work for the CSPS.
","An increase in placements will result in an increased ability to meet student learning needs and possibly increase the ability to accept more students into allied health and nursing programs. Thus addressing the shortage of anticipated healthcare workers as identified in the “Regional Labor Market Assessment, Desert/Inland Empire Region, September 2016 Report: Five-Year Projected Occupation Data for Health Care Practitioner & Technical Occupations”.  Increase numbers of faculty may also decrease attrition rates students will have increased instruction and supervision due to better faculty to student ratios
The Clinical Placement Coordinators will be responsible for directing operational aspects of the School of Nursing clinical and preceptor facilities/contracts.  They would be responsible for collaborating with the dean, chair, and director and provides oversight and tracking of student placements, student clinical requirements, and faculty clinical requirements. Additionally, this person will develop and maintain strong working relationships with placement facilities
","The Centers of Excellence identified the occupational groups in which there is the largest regional gap.  Consideration should be given to those projects that attempt to fill the gaps identified"
"This project will design and initiate development of an online regional system with two key functions: (1) CTE career planning and job readiness skills development; and (2) proactive, case-managed job placement for CTE students, especially in the priority sectors (health, life sciences/biotech, advanced transportation/renewables) and emerging sectors (advanced manufacturing and ICT/digital media).  Project staff will review evidence-based research on best practices and visit model inter-agency programs to collect the information needed to design this regional CTE career planning and placement system.  A consultant will be hired to guide development of infrastructure and processes for the regional system. 
Project activities include:
1.	Research on best practices.
2.	Visits to other institutions around the U.S. to see systems in action.
3.	Development of a plan/specifications for the regional system, which is expected to include an e-portal, a student career exploration and CTE education planning system, an online single point of contact for employers offering work-based learning opportunities, and an internship/job placement system.
4.	Short-term plan: while the regional plan is under development, provide one-time funding of $200,000 to each of the ten San Diego Imperial County Community College Association (SDICCCA) colleges.  This will fund short-term, noncontract staffing and supplies to continue the career services best practice improvements begun using CTE EF funding.
","This proposal addresses several regional needs: 
Each college has its own career services system, which is usually isolated from course content, educational planning and CTE leadership.  Many community college students do not access career planning and guidance services until they are close to leaving the institution, whether by graduation or by deciding to leave to pursue work.  Each college in the region offers some career services which may include career exploration materials and counselors available to students who make their way to the office to seek assistance.  Colleges may offer in-person individual and group counseling, and offer a series of job fairs and workshops each semester on career exploration and related topics (such as resume development, interviewing, etc.).  In addition, most colleges provide access to online career exploration information and materials on their websites.  They may also offer access to online workshops on a range of topics.  
In many majors, students must initiate career planning; it is not usually integrated into their CTE coursework. Most community college career services require the student to initiate the job search, rather than having career exploration, understanding foundational skills, and developing strong workplace skills integrated into the institution's CTE courses and ongoing student planning and information systems. Because many students attend more than one institution, students need to be able to transport their career and educational plans among the region's colleges.
Employers report that students do not have the job readiness skills or soft skills that employers need.  These skills can include adaptive, analysis/solution mindset, collaboration, communication, digital fluency, an entrepreneurial mindset, empathy, resilience, self-awareness, and social/diversity awareness.  Employers have difficulty filling jobs due to lack of qualified applicants.
Most colleges also offer links to internship search sites (and many of these links require the student to leave the college's career center website to access external sites).  There is no central site for internships and job placement; employers may be contacted by many different people from across the region looking for placements. Although the career center and CTE programs may have leads on some local internship opportunities, the student is often left to find the actual internship on their own.  
Finally, the SDICCCA colleges need expert guidance about how to design and implement the type of system envisioned.
","Utilizing the findings from multiple sector studies, regional partners identified several cross-sector employer needs/priorities:
1.	Regional employers have difficulties finding qualified employees and are interested in new ways to find and cultivate new talent. This is especially true for small businesses who may not have a human resources department or professional. Employers do not have a lot of time to search for the perfect candidate and are open to new ideas for finding job candidates.
2.	Workers with strong soft skills are essential for businesses to succeed. The number one skill requested by employers across all sectors are the soft skills – communication, professionalism, critical thinking, problem solving, etc.
3.	Soft skills make the difference in securing and retaining employment. Like the point above, if a job candidate can prove their soft skills to an employer, they have a much higher likelihood of retaining employment.
4.	Previous work experience is key for many well-paying middle-skill occupations. Previous work experience offers a lot of insight to employers without even meeting a candidate. It shows that the candidate has both technical and soft skills required for the position, as they have successfully held a previous position. Work experience gives a leg-up when the competition is tight for a position.
5.	Technical skills are required to respond to the latest innovations and technological changes. With a quickly changing technologic world, it is important for workers to keep up with new technologies for companies to remain competitive in the economy. 
6.	Industry-based certifications are an indicator to employers of a job candidate’s technical proficiency. Certifications are a great way for employers to know right off the bat what skills an individual possesses. Many certifications are approved through the state of California, resulting in a state-wide inventory of those individuals who possess a certain certificate.
7.	Small businesses have few jobs posted online, and instead rely on word-of-mouth to hire new employees. While most aspects of business have moved online, the job market is still a low-tech area. Instead of hiring an unknown individual based on a resume and interview, employers can utilize existing employees for referrals, which may be more reliable for finding new workers.
8.	Imperial County’s economy is strongly tied to the border region and cross-border trade with Mexico. While both San Diego and Imperial Counties share a border with Mexico, and trade is an important sector in both counties, Imperial’s County’s economy relies on trade with Mexico to a much greater extent.  This creates a unique opportunity in the area for innovative solutions.
9.	Many students are completing programs/graduating with degrees; however, the quality of the labor supply is unknown – this is an area for further evaluation and study. The Priority Sector Initiatives report compiles nearly 500 workforce initiatives, including hundreds of education and training programs; however, their effectiveness can be studied to determine if training gaps have, in fact, been addressed by the initiatives, or if program improvement or new programs are necessary to fill those gaps.
This proposal directly addresses the needs of the regional labor market in two ways.  First, it develops a system designed to provide case-managed job placement services to help match students with employers looking for workers with their skills.  Second, it develops a system designed to help students acquire the job readiness skills that employers indicate they require but cannot find in most applicants. 
","This proposal addresses the identified need by developing infrastructure and processes for a regional system that (a) promotes CTE student career exploration, support, and foundation workplace/career skills leading to employment related to their training; and (b) provides active student support through case-managed job placement services.  The proposed system will help all participating colleges provide the same access to quality career exploration and support services, and will provide all the participating colleges with access to programs that will help students develop workplace and career skills, including soft skills. Once complete and fully implemented, the proposed system will allow students to transport their career plans among the colleges, access regional internship opportunities, develop the work readiness skills they need, and get help to find a job in their field.","The Southern Border Region Workforce Development Planning group established nine common tenets and workforce priorities during the planning of the four-year regional plan required under the Strong Workforce Program and the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA).  The nine priorities are presented in Appendix A.  The proposed system will directly address the first strategic priority, coordinating industry engagement and developing a single entry point for business customers. Today, the public workforce system engages employers by program, with different people from different organizations calling employers to hire their participants. We change this by taking a “demand driven” approach to business services. San Diego’s public workforce system must engage businesses by sector under a common strategy with a coordinated sales force.  The project will address this by developing an e-portal for work-based learning opportunities, and will have the capacity to coordinate employer contacts and involvement in the region."
"Proposal to encourage, fund, and facilitate adoption of the Cyberpatriots program to enhance IT and Cybersecurity K-12 pathways.

Build Bay Region-wide participation in the K-12 Cyberpatriot program to develop IT and Cyber Security pathways.  Outreach will include hosting Cyberpatriot camps and competition rounds, engaging, encouraging, and supporting local K-12 teachers as Cyberpatriot Coaches, connecting with local cyber security industry,  and developing articulation for college credit.

","From a recent Burning Glass Technologies Research reprot:  ""American employers have realized the vital importance of cybersecurity—but that realization has created a near-term shortage of workers that may require long-term solutions.""  

According to Burning Glass ""the demand for these workers is outstripping supply. Job postings for cybersecurity openings have grown three times as fast as openings for IT jobs overall and it takes companies longer to fill cybersecurity positions than other IT jobs. 

","It has been said that gaining cybersecurity skills can require up to 10,000 hours of experience.  This project starts the clock early in middle and high school.  The Cyberpatriot program helps to provide the engagement and hands-on experience that the employment requires.  

The cybersecurity talent gap exists across the country.  The gap is particularly large in the Bay Region.  According to Cyberseek there are over 20,000 cybersecurity job openings in Silicon Valley, SF Peninsula and East Bay sub regions alone.   The Cyberseek project is supported by the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE), a program of the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the U.S. Department of Commerce, under Grant #60NANB15D267.  (http://cyberseek.org/index.html)","CyberPatriot is the premier national cyber defense program and competition that brings together multiple skills for middle and high school students to work together as a team in a virtual environment to solve real-world cybersecurity problems. The challenges presented in the competition help students build skills today for a future career in cybersecurity. Competition challenges include forensics, networking, and securing various operating systems such as Windows desktop, Windows server, and Linux.

The community colleges of the Bay Region are committed to becoming a premier source of well trained cybersecurity an IT professionals. Programs like CyberPatriot help develop the flow of students into the Community College IT training programs.

With the successful completion of this proposal we hope that the Bay Region community colleges participating in this effort, will successfully apply and achieve the status of a CyberPatriot Center of Excellence (COE) program. COEs are recognized higher education institutions who have successfully promoted and supported the CyberPatriot program.

","ICT has been identified as a ""Priority"" or ""Emerging"" sector in each of the sub regions of the Bay Region.  "
"In the Bay Area, there are over 346,000 high school students who are potential “customers” for the Community Colleges. Through supporting the creation and sustainability of K14 Pathways, Colleges have the opportunity to increase FTES by building the enrollment pipeline and early college credit opportunities for students. Robust K14 Pathways help K12 students better understand their options for postsecondary education and careers, and support better preparation for and persistence in college programs. 


This regional project emphasizes building up backbone supports for K14 Pathways, with the goal of increasing capacity within colleges to develop robust pathways, and increasing consistency in practice across colleges. Regional coordination is a critical element of this proposal. 


The four elements of this proposal are:
Developing & Mapping Career Pathways; Increasing Early College Credit; Early Intervention/Awareness of Pathways; and, Expanding Work-Based Learning 
","While various state, local and regional initiatives are currently in place to encourage deeper relationships between community college and K-12 systems (especially through career pathways), resources for these efforts vary by geography within the Bay Region, with several grant initiatives scheduled to sunset in the next 1-3 years. 

In addition, many colleges are in the process of developing and refining their local policies and practices related to CTE career pathways, including work-based learning, dual enrollment and early awareness/outreach/counseling. Absent this regional project, and given shifts in grant funding within the region, there is limited capacity at present to coordinate across colleges.   

Regional strategies and support are necessary to more consistently and effectively deepen relationships between K-12 and community colleges, and ensure that individual colleges leverage promising practices and the learnings of their peers. ","Employers in critical Bay Region industries (such as advanced manufacturing, transportation & logistics, information communication technology and health) frequently cite the need to build up the long term pipeline of workers by more effectively engaging students at younger ages, long before they matriculate to college.  

Career pathways from K-12 into college offer a mechanism to help build awareness of careers, increase exposure to the nature of work in these industries, and enhance work-based/professionalism skills.  

Employers also frequently note that while they are interested in supporting the education system with work-based learning, it is difficult to understand how to connect. 

This project not only focuses on supporting colleges as they develop and enhance career pathways, it also focuses on cross-college initiatives to build a more aligned approach to engaging employers. ","This proposal builds capacity for cross-college collaboration around career pathways, to encourage consistency in local policies, adoption of promising practices and leverage of existing resources.  

To achieve these goals, this proposal focuses on offering professional development, facilitating communities of practice, creating shared resources and coordinating cross-college iniatiaves to support colleges as they develop and enhance career pathways.  ","In alignment with the Strong Workforce Taskforce Recommendations, the Bay Region also supports development of robust career pathways. "
"Transportation is a growing sector in the Sacramento region with demand for automotive service technicians, aircraft dispatchers, and air traffic controllers, among other technical positions.  In the first phase of this investment, Los Rios will sponsor a business plan to identify programs that need to be developed, enhanced or expanded based on the regional labor market needs.  In year 1 and 2, Los Rios will fund the implementation of the most presenting needs identified in the business plan at ARC, CRC, and SCC. 

In addition to the business plan, Los Rios will invest in two additional transportation projects. American River College will serve as a regional hub to provide alternative fuel vehicle training and resources though a mobile training lab. In the first year, ARC will purchase a trailer and rigging, as well as teaching aids for plug-in hybrid and electric vehicle training.  In years two and three, ARC will purchase additional vehicles and equipment for the mobile training lab. 

Cosumnes River College will purchase equipment to prepare students for the licensed Smog Check Inspector state exam. By having the capability that allows students to complete the mandatory skill requirements on-site, CRC will draw more students to the program. In addition, the specialty state license (Smog Check Inspector) equates to a higher starting wage than those applying without the licensure. ","The advanced transportation sector is experiencing a shortage of skilled workers, in areas such as automotive technology, diesel mechanics, alternative fuels, air craft controllers, licensed SMOG inspectors, among other areas.  Employers at a recent workforce symposium, hosted by Valley Vision, voiced concerns over finding qualified technical workers for open positions both now and in the future.","This investment is designed to increase the number of trained, qualified workers entering the advanced transportation workforce.  This meets the needs of the region's labor market because many advanced transportation employers prefer to hire graduates from community college programs over private education institutions. The main reason is that community college graduates have a better foundation of basic knowledge and adapt quickly to industry standards and requirements, while private education graduates have a steep learning curve. ","The project addresses the needs by 2) increasing the pipeline of trained, qualified workers entering the advanced transportation sector; and 3) preparing students for successful completion of state licensing exams to qualify for advanced, better paying positions.","This proposal directly addresses the following NFN Regional Consortium priority: 'Align college programs with regional and industry needs and provide support of CTE programs' by expanding and enhancing programs that align with the regional labor market needs."
"Build the capacity of the region's community colleges to connect CTE students to employers and available jobs.","Region Nine does not have a collaborative effort to provide job development and placement for students within the region. This proposal provides for a job developers at each of the 13 colleges and 2 regional job developers for the Region Nine. These individuals would be primarily responsible for seeking out jobs in their respective areas for students graduating from CTE programs. The Regional job developers would work with college/district job developers to identify jobs that may be available in areas where the college does not offer the CTE program, but it is offered at one of the other Region Nine colleges. The job developers would then seek students with the identified industry skills to match the job opening and procure interviews or job placement with the companies identified. This meets one of the metrics of the Strong Workforce dollars in that it increases the number of students who are placed in jobs that are within their CTE Certificate/AA degree skill set.","There continue to be gaps between labor market demand and connecting qualified students to employers in order to meet the demand.","Fund job development and placement coordinators at the region's colleges who will identify jobs available to CTE students and conduct and coordinate job fairs and employability workshops. These college coordinators would also coordinate and collaborate with other regional college job placement coordinators and placement counselors on a regional level to identify jobs outside of the scope of local CTE certificates and degrees and local geographic employment regions.","Job development and employment placement was identified as a significant gap during regional SWP planning, including the need for regional approach to this activity."
"Paid internships will be provided for students in a variety of disciplines with salaries provided for discipline-specific faculty coordinators for Regional Internship at each of the three (3) VCCCD colleges: Ventura, Oxnard, and Moorpark. Funds will also be used for faculty coordination, office supplies and equipment required to create a central internship office at each college with Ventura College acting as the primary college for this project.
","According to the California Community Colleges’ Task Force on Workforce Job Creation and a Strong Economy released in April, 2015 work-based learning, such as internships and project-based learning opportunities can help students apply their knowledge, gain valuable hands-on experience, and develop the day-one readiness and fundamental skills necessary to secure and succeed in the labor market.   Paid work-based learning and apprenticeship programs allow students to develop relevant skills while earning money to cover living expenses. Without access to these opportunities, many students will seek paid employment unrelated to their pathways and likely slow their college completion and career advancement.
Internships provide students the opportunity to apply the theories and techniques of their discipline in an internship position in a professional setting under the instruction of a faculty-mentor and site supervisor. It introduces students to aspects of the roles and responsibilities of professionals employed in the field of study. Topics to be covered include goal-setting, employment skills development, and examination of the world of work as it relates to the student's career plans. Internships will last one semester and students may repeat the internship up to two time.  Students may not earn more than 16 units in any combination of cooperative work experience(general or occupational) and/or internship studies during community college attendance.
","The California Community Colleges' Workforce Task Force Recommendations suggests that student success can be improved by the addition of activities around career exploration and planning, work-based learning opportunities, and other supports for students.
Along with learning about a specific discipline students can also earn money for their daily living costs and may lead to future employment.  Although employment isn’t guaranteed at the end of an internship, many employers use internships as a way to train and evaluate future employees. In fact, a 2009 NACE survey of U.S. employers with interns found that 67% of those interns were given job offers after their terms were complete.
","This proposal will address the need for work-based training in a specific discipline while attending college.  It allows the student to learn their chosen profession while earning money to pay for daily living costs.  
According to US News and World Report the benefits of an internship during college include:
1.	Apply knowledge learned in the classroom. 
2.	Gain valuable work experience. 
3.	Decide if this is the right path for you. 
4.	Develop and build upon skills. 
5.	Get a foot in the door at a company. 
6.	Gain valuable networking contacts. 
7.	Obtain references for future job opportunities. 
8.	Learn about the world of work. 
9.	Meet peers with similar interests.

","This proposal will allow Career and Technical Education (CTE) students from all disciplines across the region to engage in a paid internship experience for at least one semester.  Not only will the paid internship provide the student a valuable learning experience in the work setting, but it will also allow the student to remain in the internship by providing him/her with adequate funds for daily living expenses."
"The Los Rios Community College District Global Trade and Logistics (GTL) programs will partner with its public and private sector partners in a regional collaborative effort to introduce new global trade and entrepreneurship programs within the North region and its rural communities. This program will create global business competency and fluency in the subsectors identified above to our students and workforce participants, enabling them to be better prepared for regional jobs having global duties and responsibilities. The project will also deliver expanded global trade skills to empower employers and businesses to compete more successfully in the international marketplace. National statistics show that wage gains for globally competent workers are 18% higher than those who are not trained. SMEs that export enjoyed a 37% growth in revenue over the past four years versus a 7% decline in revenue for those who did not export.
An included component of this project will provide existing entrepreneurs, rural entrepreneurs and aspiring entrepreneurs with global digital marketing skills to make international online sales, ship globally and take payments through encrypted portals from the comfort of their offices and businesses here in the Greater Sacramento Valley and Far North Region. CITD Director Dr. Raj Shea at Mission College has offered to connect his new digital marketing Industry Driven Regional Collaborative (IDRC) to our proposed project.","In 2014 California exported $174 billion of products world-wide. Of the 19.2 million California labor force, 4.7 million jobs are related to global trade. One in ten California small businesses are exporting. The businesses and labor force in the North region are no different. With the addition of over $1Billion in new export sales of product and services in 2015, as publicly reported by the US Department of Commerce International Trade Administration for the Sacramento- Arden Arcade Metro Region, business demand for job seekers who are globally proficient and globally competent is unmet and there is are no training programs at the community colleges that currently provide these skills. According to the same federal agency, their data shows that these $1Billion in new export sales were made by the industry sectors the “next economy” identified as the top sectors in the North Region. The federal government estimates that for every $1m in new export trade, approximately 5 jobs are either retained or created. $1Billion X 5= Is a big impact on jobs and industry in this region and, jobs with global trade duties pay 16% more in wages as reported by the US Department of Commerce Manufacturing and Services Economic Brief July 2010. When we include the agricultural businesses and workforce located in the rural communities which dominate the North state, the need for global trade knowledge and job skills increases. Forty-six percent of California’s agriculture businesses sell globally.","Global trade is not an industry sector or a set of jobs but rather a compilation of expanded workforce job skills and business knowledge that cross cuts all priority industry sectors and their LMI supported CTE needs statewide. As such, this program integrates the global trade skills into existing interdisciplinary programs to increase the number of students that are prepared to compete into the global marketplace.","This is a program that will integrate global trade skills into existing curriculum so that students are better prepared for jobs and careers that require global proficiency. In addition, this program will connect students to hands on activities that will better prepare them for the global marketplace.
Teaching global competency in a career-focused context gives students the opportunity to acquire
important skills needed for success in many careers that are part of the current economy. The more
effective, sustainable approach is to integrate global themes and content into existing coursework, not a separate global CTE class. The examples included in this publication are intended to provide support for CTE educators as they seek to incorporate global competencies into their own CTE curriculum. This will lead to greater engagement and achievement of students as well as provide a pipeline of workers and lifelong learners who will be able to engage globally and grow the region’s economy.","This proposal addresses the priorities of both the Regional Leaders of the six-county region in Sacramento and the identified priorities of North Far-North Regional Consortia. Capital Region Prosperity Plan Advisory Committee “NEXT Economy” report documents existing and future global trade regional priority needs by community leaders and businesses."
"Enhance the CTE Dual Enrollment offering/sections and opportunities to different high schools in our region.","This proposal addresses the need to increase the number of students pursuing a college education, specifically for CTE programs. It also addresses the industry need for individuals who possess soft skills and technical skills. Should students who complete these dual enrollment courses decide to forego a college education, they will have gained technical skills that will carry into the workforce, making them more prepared for the workforce.","According to EMSI labor reports, it is anticipated that there will be an increase in the need for welders in 2018, with an estimated 1,849 welding positions becoming available.  By allowing students to earn dual enrollment units in the welding program through their high school, students will have a more advanced skillset to bring into the workforce and fill these positions.  Regional colleges will work on different CTE programs will local ROP groups to enhance CTE offerings throughout the region.  The project will align regional efforts and will help colleges have a uniform process to offer dual enrollment in CTE areas.","By allowing students to earn college credit while they are still in high school, the likelihood of students pursuing a college education increases. This will also help students shorten the amount of time that they spend in college and increase completion rates. Students will also gain technical skills that they can use in the workforce.","This proposal helps to increase awareness of and participation in CTE programs, as well as increase the amount of middle skill credentials earned by allowing high school students to take dual enrollment CTE courses. It will also assist in aligning high school and community college curriculum by establishing pathways for CTE programs, allowing a smooth transition from high school to community college. In addition, high school students will participate in career exploration and job preparation activities, serving to better prepare them for the workforce."
"Development of a regional collaborative group to align and articulate the lower division electronics courses required for admission to the Bachelor of Science degree in Industrial Automation at Bakersfield College.  The group will meet regularly via conference calls and participate together in the Industrial Automation Advisory Committee meetings for the baccalaureate degree.","The San Joaquin Valley has a large base of production and logistics facilities serving industry sectors ranging from agricultural, manufacturing, transportation to energy. All of these industry sectors utilize automated processes requiring a workforce trained in mechatronics or industrial automation. Thus, precipitating the need for a highly skilled automation workforce.  Currently, the valley has 154 annual openings in positions requiring degrees or certificates in automation related fields. 
","The region’s labor market data indicates demand for automation related positions outweighs supply in the region. Strengthening the pathway via curricular alignment and articulation will increase the number of community college students earning certificates, associate degrees and baccalaureate degrees, subsequently preparing them for employment in automation related industries.","To meet the workforce demand, this proposal will address building capacity for a cohesive academic pathway in industrial automation with a stackable design of certificates, associates degrees and baccalaureate degree. Planned activities include curricular alignment of lower division electronics or manufacturing technology programs, development of stackable certificates and the associate degree in industrial automation, articulation of the lower division technical courses required for the Bachelor of Science degree in Industrial Automation at Bakersfield College, and regional participation in the Industrial Automation Advisory Committee at Bakersfield College. ","The Advanced Manufacturing Sector, in which Industrial Automation is included, is designated as a priority by the Central Valley Region."

"Sierra College has insufficient facilities for its robust and high demand public safety sectors programs. There are 2,100 students enrolled in public safety classes each semester. Public safety includes administration of justice, health science and fire technology. Sierra College is planning a new public safety facility for its main Rocklin site but this is not expected to be constructed for a few years. Sierra College’s Nevada County Center (NCC) in Nevada City has space with infrastructure for locating more facilities at this location. The proposal is to use SWP funds to add facilities to increase the public safety offerings at the NCC. Specifically, this location and facilities would be used to add a Fire Academy at this location. 
Mendocino-Lake College District has 4 campus sites strategically located in a 3,200 square mile rural remote area of the north coast with a population of 150,000 residents. There are 508 students enrolled in public safety courses in the 2016/17 school year. The Ukiah main campus will offer the Firefighter I Academy course each semester for the lecture coursework. The lab clinical section of the fire science courses will be sited at the CalFire, Howard Forrest Station which is 14 miles north of the main campus. This fully developed CalFire operations training facility is the command center for Mendocino –Lake County police, fire emergency communications response network for our region.
Lassen College:  There is a significant need for wildland firefighters in Lassen County, El Dorado County and Northern California. This program has been one of our most successful programs for some time, but with insufficient resources we have not been able to take the program to the next level offering more courses and producing more graduates. These graduates have the ability to seek wage earning jobs. We have also been asked by the Office of the State Fire Marshall to create a Fire Academy. Men and women in our area must relocate to attend a fire academy and for many that simply is not possible. The local fire departments cannot hire anyone who has not completed the certifications required in a fire science academy, hence their reason for asking us to consider it. The funding from this grant will provide much needed resources to produce more employable graduates, as well as make the program very sustainable. An additional aspect in public safety is in Wilderness Education/Leadership, particularly in the Lake Tahoe basin. Backcountry usage has increased significantly in recent years, both in summer and winter, increasing the need for guides, rangers, and Search and Rescue, including technical rope, backcountry, swift-water and flat-water rescue. 
Preliminary conversations have taken place in which Yuba College has been asked to consider providing some police academy training under their certifications. Discussions included potentially presenting an interactive teleconferencing course at an offsite location simultaneously with the regular academy class held at the Yuba College campus. Some additional staff would be need for skills testing and some scenario activities; however, those details could be worked out at a later date.   The teleconferencing concept has been done with police academy training, so we would be a model for others to follow around the state and possibly the nation.  Yuba's proposal would fill a tremendous need for more police academy training in the Far Northern Region of the state. Additionally, all communities would benefit from this joint effort and both the quality and quantity of police training for Northern California would be greatly enhanced. This proposal would be a mutually beneficial situation for all parties involved; the students, law enforcement agencies, the communities and colleges.","There is a need for more trained fire fighters in the region and in the state. The Community College League of California estimates that 80 percent of the state’s firefighters, law enforcement officers and emergency medical technicians received their training at a firefighter academy on or affiliated with a local Community College campus. Community colleges provide excellent training for prospective firefighters in a much more cost effective way than if cities, counties and districts had to pay for private instruction for their employees. 

Sierra College’s Fire Technology Program includes an AA/AS degree, Certificates of Achievement and Career Advancement Certificates. The program provides a “one stop shop” for initial and career fire service training. This includes State Firefighter 1 & 2, Company and Chief Officer Training, and specialty training including HazMat, Driver and Investigations. The program meets state and national training standards. Sierra College is the first community college to offer Fire Fighter 2 training.

Mendocino-Lake College has developed working advisory boards with Volunteer/Municipal/State Fire Service agencies that meet monthly to plan collaborative certifications and training activities. All of these fire agencies have requested Mendocino-Lake College District to take the lead on developing and offering current courses to meet the new State Fire Marshall course requirements for NFPA professional firefighter qualifications. We will also seek to become an accredited regional training test site approved by the California State Board of Fire Services verified by the State Fire Marshall’s Office.  Lake Tahoe Community College (LTCC) serves and partners with numerous municipal fire protection districts, plus CAL-Fire and the U.S. Forest Service. This proposal will address the need for more trained firefighters, as well as those in the public safety arena related to wilderness careers and regional Search and Rescue.
","There is not enough regional specialized facility capacity (Sierra & Lassen) or course capacity (Mendocino/Lake) to meet the regional demand for fire fighters. The demand has increased due to the closure of the Sacramento area Regional Center which was closed due to operational problems. Sierra recently turned away 60 students due to capacity limitations. At the same time, there is demand for graduates.  There are 12 agencies that take 169 paid full-time interns every year. CalFire hires 50 per year. Between Sierra and Yuba, there are only 90 students graduating per year. This proposal would increase the number of fire fighters that would be trained annually by 60-80 per semester.
The LMI data for the North Coast/Santa Rosa area is 48 firefighters. This data represents the fire strike force before the current legislation was in effect that reduced the inmate firefighting population. This legislation cut wildland fires crews by 60%  in the Mendocino/Lake region.
The local Lassen National Forest offers hundreds of jobs a year. Lassen college hopes to give training to entry level firefighters so they have the certification needed to gain employment. Cal-Fire has 30-35 local openings and over 500 state wide. Lassen College hopes to give the state training required to gain employment with Cal-fire or local Fire Departments.  The LTCC Wilderness Education program trains aspiring outdoor professionals and recreationalists for rewarding careers. Examples of local jobs related to Wilderness Education includes Emergency Medical Technicians and Paramedics, Fish and Game Wardens and Wilderness Ranger, ski patrol, backcountry ski guide, rock climbing guide, alpine guide, wilderness ranger, forest service and state parks recreation positions. The U.S. Forest Service is a major employer in the region, and visitors to the Lake Tahoe basin and surrounding state parks and national forests have increased substantially, creating an increasing need for qualified professionals to fill jobs in the industry.   
","For Sierra College, there is an opportunity to add a Public Safety Training Center on 3-acres of the NCC campus. Evening and weekend fire academies are offered currently. With the addition of a training tower, equipment/apparatus storage and 2-3 classrooms and props., a training center could be established at the NCC site for $600,000. Utilities and pads are in place. This is a one-time cost for a 40-week Fire academy. The addition of these facilities increases the capacity for adding classes and enrollment for the Fire Academy.

The need for increased firefighters in the Mendocino-Lake College District is acute and extreme as evidenced by the closure of 3 out of 5 fire camps in the past 6 months within the District boundaries due to the state legislated inmate release program. The devastating fires in Lake & Mendocino Counties were well-documented by local and national media last summer. These fires wiped out entire communities. The fire danger is high in Mendocino and Lake Counties.

The local Lassen National Forest offers hundreds of jobs a year. Lassen college hopes to give training to entry level firefighters so they have the certification needed to gain employment. Cal-Fire has 30-35 local openings and over 500 state wide. Lassen College hopes to give the state training required to gain employment with Cal-fire or local Fire Departments.  This proposal includes costs to hire a consultant to expand the Wilderness Education program at LTCC as well as assist in funding a dedicated LTCC Fire Academy training location at the Lake Valley Fire Protection District. LTCC currently leases access to a burn tower in Carson City, Nevada and uses temporary training facilities at the Lake Tahoe Airport. These locations create challenges with both distance to the college and a lack of clean, dry storage for equipment and supplies. Having a permanent facility will assist with Fire Science program expansion and help fill in-demand jobs in the region. 
","As a region, despite Fire Academy programs at nine colleges, there is insufficient capacity to train all of the fire fighters needed through a Fire Academy program. Sierra College is turning away local applicants for the Fire Academy and is unable to provide enough trained candidates for local internships and positions. Sierra College has been limited by both facility capacity and an area for specialized equipment, particularly in the eastern service area. Sierra College has three acres on its NCC site with infrastructure that is available for adding a Fire Academy. This proposal provides one-time funding to purchase and install the classrooms and specialized equipment needed for an additional Fire Academy. 
The Mendocino-Lake District had one A.S. degree graduate in Fire Science in the spring of 2016. The need to dramatically expand Fire Science program is a critical priority for the region. Increasing entry level firefighting coursework, like the Firefighting Academy, is an urgent community need. 
The local Forest Service, CalFire, and Susanville Fire agencies are willing to partner with us to fulfill this need. All of these agencies are well aware of the challenges faced trying to find seasonal and full-time employees. We are also looking to collaborate with Mendocino’s Fire Science program at the Spring Fire Summit.  The Lake Tahoe basin and surrounding region has experienced a number of damaging and costly wildfires in recent years, and the community and region lack dedicated training facilities and qualified personnel to assist in filling family-sustaining, high-demand jobs in the region. Additionally, there is a regional need for more Search and Rescue personnel, in swift-water and flat-water and year-round in the backcountry. It allows LTCC to partner with Sierra College on the revamp of the curriculum as mandated by recent changes with the State Fire Marshal, and provides both colleges the opportunity to collaborate with Mendocino's Fire Science program at the Spring Fire Summit.
It has been identified that the Northern California region has experienced, and continues to see an increased demand in the POST Modular Academies.  Since this has been identified, Yuba College has diligently worked to meet the needs of the region.  Public Safety Directors have been in communication recently identifying the need to offer additional training classes to meet rural communities’ needs. "

This project will also attract more ECE enrollment and increase FTES over the course of the project as students will want to enroll and will be able to be increasingly successful in completion.","The regional labor market indicates that there are many unfilled positions in ECE and K-8 schools. This proposal will help prepare students entering the labor market for the types of technological challenges they will face today and prepare them for those in coming years.","This proposal aims to provide Early Childhood and Elementary Education students with the tools, skills and confidence to enter the ECE and K-8 professions equipped with 21st Century technology tools. The equipment from this project will be used directly with students at the participating colleges to prepare them for employment in the field and give them a competitive edge with the skills acquired by using this equipment. ","The Child Development/Early Childhood Education priority is based on regional market needs.  Unfortunately the is no Community College sector designated for Education."
"Sacramento City College has a well-established and highly successful Mechanical Electrical Technology Program that specializes in commercial and residential HVACR and environmental control systems. It is the only program of its type in the NFN region. For the past sixty plus years, the college has made significant investments in staffing, curriculum, equipment, facilities and supplies to support this program.  The result is a department with significant respect within the industry and a long history and tradition of successful graduates working in the commercial and residential HVACR industry.  The student laboratories and equipment within the department are especially impressive, and expensive.  The labs are “living labs” in that students have access to a wide variety of trainer equipment, but also access to the mechanical electrical systems in the college buildings.  The SCC MET student labs are unique in the North Far North Region.  These labs are not easily reproduced, are immobile, and distance education is not viable for this type of hands-on learning. Therefore, Sacramento City College’s MET department proposes to leverage its resources, expand their current program and partner with other colleges in the region to address increased industry demand for skilled workers in HVACR, Environmental Control Systems, and Energy Efficiency. This would involve establishing a regional hub at SCC to serve as a resource for all participating colleges,  coordinating a regional approach to meeting industry demand, and working with colleges to develop new programs or courses, integrate new curriculum into existing programs, strengthen and expand existing  programs, coordinate with industry, conduct marketing and outreach, and develop mobile training capabilities. 

Butte College – Butte College is in a similar situation to Shasta College in recognizing the potential for HVACR training in the Chico area. Butte College would like to participate in the regional collaboration and explore options for addressing this subject area. 

Mendocino College – Mendocino College currently offers a Certificate of Achievement in Residential Performance and Efficiency that includes introductory HVAC courses. While outreach to local industry suggests employment opportunities, this certificate has been struggling to attract enough students to fill/offer these courses. Mendocino would like to work with Sacramento City College and the regional collaborative to revamp their program, strengthen ties with local industry, and expand marketing/outreach. Mendocino College has budgeted $5,000 in 2017 to begin these activities. 

Sierra College – Sierra College has a well-established construction and solar energy program. HVAC could integrate well into their existing programs and/or expand off existing programs. As a college that is in closer proximity to SCC they want to coordinate in a way that makes sense for the region and doesn’t compete with SCC or other local programs. Sierra College intends to participate in the regional collaborative to explore options for introductory courses and/or hosting a mobile training capability.

Cosumnes River College – Cosumnes River College has a well-established construction and residential energy performance program. They have an interest in working with Sacramento City College to offer one or more introductory courses. Students interested in further studies in HVACR would be able to attend SCC for enhanced training.  

Jim Caldwell, Sector Navigator and Statewide Director, Energy, Construction & Utilities and  Orion Walker, Prop 39 Director, North Far North Region met with SCC faculty and administration and assisted with the development of this plan. Both have provided significant advice and support and have assisted in gaining support from the participating colleges.  Jim Caldwell’s proposal “A Tiered Approach to Upgrading HVACR Programs” will be integrated into this proposal.  Jim’s report stated that “Regional HVACR collaboratives are now emerging in the South Coast, Central Valley, San Diego, Bay Area and Sacramento/North to replicate the system pioneered by the initial five colleges.”
","This proposal addresses the labor shortage for qualified HVACR technicians for the residential and commercial industry in the NFNR. Industry and LMI data indicate there is a strong need to train HVACR technicians. Students also need to be prepared for EPA licensing and correct safety procedures for handling refrigerant materials. Sacramento City College is also interested in expanding its offerings to include Commercial Building Auditing and there is a need to update all HVACR programs in the state to common standards.","The regional collaborative, with SCC MET as a resource hub for the region, will lead to an increased number of trained HVACR technicians across an expanded range of skill sets that are aligned with regional industry needs. Through enhancement of existing programs, curriculum and skills alignment, regional coordination with industry, and development of new programs this collaborative will lead to increased and improved training opportunities throughout the NFN region. ","The proposal addresses the identified needs by creating a regional collaborative of colleges, establishing a regional industry advisory board, and assisting colleges in the NFNRC to establish their own on site HVACR programs thereby leveraging the significant resources and expertise housed at SCC MET department. SCC proposes partnering with the Western HVACR Alliance (WHPA) and other colleges on   updating all HVACR programs to common standards to ensure transferable credits benchmarked to industry-recognized credentials.","According to the North State Building Industry Association, there is a severe shortage of qualified and trained Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning, and Refrigeration (HVACR) technicians in our region. These findings are supported by a national study conducted by Burning Glass Technologies in 2015, and a study conducted by the Western HVAC Performance Alliance (WHPA) in November 2016. .  Over the next three years, employers in the region plan to hire more than 300 HVACR technicians, while regional education institutions are only conferring an average of 33 awards each year.  Given this projected training shortage, the NFNRC is allocating Strong Workforce Program funds to expand HVACR programs."
"Project 1: 
The mobile high-fidelity simulation lab will provide students and employees with access to high-fidelity ‘patients’ with focused feedback in a managed stress environment.  Students will gain critical industry skills by working with high-fidelity ‘patients’ that are actually human-like, computerized mannequins.  These simulators are the most technologically advanced training tools available to the medical community today.  They can breathe, talk, and react to medication.  They can die.  However, unlike humans, these patients come back to life again and again, providing the ideal learning environment to gain skills without the risk of harm to real people. The mobile high-fidelity simulation lab will provide thousands of employees the opportunity to work directly with their local team members using this unique mobile platform.  

Project 2: 
CRC will update its EMS lab by replacing the college’s outdated 1970’s CPR manikins with high-fidelity simulation equipment. As with the mobile unit, this update will allow students to learn through a portfolio skills assessment of “real life” scenarios.","The new standard in EMS care requires the use of high-fidelity simulation equipment.  ","Small public safety and emergency healthcare employers in the region do not have access to high-fidelity simulation equipment due to time and economic restrictions.  Because the mobile simulator will to travel to the user, local employers will have access to the most technologically advanced training tools available to the medical community today.  The mobile lab is projected to conservatively train over 2100 & 3400 employees during the second year third year for a project total of 44,000 WSCH

Second, since the mobile simulator lab will be utilized heavily by local public safety employers, CRC is updating their equipment to ensure that graduating students will have the skills needed to be successful in the workforce.","The proposal addresses the need by (1) providing updated equipment for college training and (2) providing a mobile unit that allows for real time, onsite, and cost-effective incumbent employee training.","This proposal directly addresses the following NFN Regional Consortium priority:  'Align college programs with regional and industry needs and provide support of CTE programs.' By equipping the colleges with high-fidelity simulation equipment, students and incumbent workers will have the skills needed to provide effective emergency care services."
"Establish a CTE Labor Market Support Center that will collaborate with the the SCCRC Regional Centers of Excellence Technical Assistance Provider, Sector Navigators, Deputy Sector Navigators, Consortium Chairs and other workforce and labor market entities. ","The collection of district and college student outcomes data for CTE programs related to employment has been the responsibility of individual programs. This varied and scattered approach to a very time consuming activity has lead to inconsistent data gathering and analyses. This proposal, following the Strong Work Force Recommendations, will improve the quality, accessibility, and utility of regionally collected labor market data. ","This proposal will allow the district colleges to monitor employment levels of graduating CTE students, evaluating its impact on supply and demand within the regional labor market. ","The District CTE/Labor Market Support Center will support college and district level CTE programs in the collection of labor market data and needs assessment, and will track program-specific success rates and outcomes, including employment data as required by accrediting agencies, the Department of Education (Gainful Employment), California State Approving Agency for Veterans Education (CSAAVE), and other reporting agencies.","The South Central Regional Consortium goal #4 is to align college programs with regional and industry needs and provide support for CTE programs.  This proposal will support  the Ventura County Community College District regional subgroup to accomplish this. This proposal is in direct support of this goal to meet the local labor market demands. A greater understanding of the placement of our students within the labor market will help us meet this need with great precision. "
"The North State Building Industry Foundation will provide student recruiting, student internship development and student employment placement services to the Los Rios Community College campuses in relation to Building and Construction Trades, Professional Careers, and Business and Finance Careers. The Foundation will work with community college staff to:
1.	Promote community college courses to  youth and adults at high school career fairs, community job fairs;
2.	Pass out promotional information to high schools counselors and instructors, community-based organizations (including churches), and America’s Career Centers;
3.	Develop paid internships and place students with employers;
4.	Place graduating students into jobs in the construction or related industries;
5.	Develop an Industry recognized 5kin5 certificate reflecting the student’s relationship with employers. 
6.	Develop work-based learning experiences for students and instructors. 
","1) Construction Labor Shortages: The Employment Development Department estimates that between 2012 & 2022 that 30,000 (29,810) people will be hired in the construction trades in a variety of trades in El Dorado, Placer, Sacramento, and Yolo Counties.

2) Shortage of Experienced Skilled Labor: The greatest need is for skilled labor of which there is no supply. 


","There is a significant labor shortage for skilled construction workers in the Sacramento Region. The labor shortage has resulted in project delays and reduce economic activity, which is detrimental to the industry as well as the overall economy.  This investment addresses the shortage by increasing the pipeline of qualified, trained workers entering the construction field.","This proposal addresses the need by increasing the pipeline of skilled and qualified workers entering the construction field through recruitment, internships and job placement services.","This proposal directly addresses the following NFN Regional Consortium priority:  'Align college programs with regional and industry needs and provide support of CTE programs.'

"The Seamless Pathways from Noncredit to Credit Initiative will create a regional resource for collaboration between Orange County’s Adult Education providers and Community Colleges. In an effort for help students complete higher level certificates and degrees, the shared goal will be to significantly enhance, improve and align opportunities for students to seamlessly transition from noncredit to credit Career Technical Education (CTE) programs. The project will create a sustainable management position that is to provide support to the region as a liaison, convener, and collaborator of noncredit to credit opportunities and pathways. The manager will work regionally with Deputy Sector Navigators, Regional Adult Education Block Grant Consortia, community colleges, noncredit providers, Workforce Development Boards, One-Stop Centers, and both noncredit and credit faculty to identify best practices for seamless transition from Adult Education to Community College. This includes: identify new pathway opportunities; oversee the development and/or revision of noncredit curriculum and certificate programs; implement new pathway opportunities and transition processes; promote the pathways to regional high schools, ROP's and workforce partners; and help align any new certificates to potential 3rd party certifications. The Initiative goals include increased transition from noncredit to credit and increased completion of both noncredit and credit state approved certificates, associate degrees, applied bachelor’s degrees, and/or third-party credentials that lead to increased longer-term employment at higher wages. Unemployed or underemployed adults will have opportunities to enter noncredit CTE programs and gain employment skills for entry level work. Once attained, they also will be able to seamlessly transition into higher level certificate and degree options to continue on their career ladder for increased opportunities and higher wages.","Noncredit Career Technical Education (CTE) curriculum and certificate programs are continuing to grow throughout the Orange County region. They serve the needs of adult students wishing to enter or re-enter the workforce and help local industry partners and employers meet their skilled workforce needs. These programs help students gain entry-level employment. However, not all of these opportunities lead to high-skill or high-wage jobs without obtaining more advanced training such as those offered through the Community College's credit CTE certificates and degrees. Current efforts to align noncredit courses and programs with credit courses/certificates/degrees has faced many challenges including: how to facilitate seamless transition of students from noncredit to credit; the nonexistence of alignment of noncredit courses and programs throughout the region;  the inability to dissolve the boundaries between noncredit and credit; and the need of our adult students to have pathways to more advanced learning opportunities without having to repeat skills already gained in noncredit.
There are many regional alignment efforts occurring throughout the state and region. Yet, many still continue to focus on the K-12 pipeline to community colleges. As the average age of the CTE students continues to increase and our underemployed/unemployed adult populations grows, this proposal will help create a stronger regional focus on noncredit CTE. It will enhance its ability to serve all students within the community, as well as its alignment to the community college’s credit programs and capturing all potential students anywhere on the spectrum from high school to older adult. ","In Orange County there is a need to both diversify the career pathways available to a wide range of K-14 students, as well as providing convening organizations to coordinate activities and efforts. All the LMI information collected and described in the region’s proposal reinforce that there is a current and continuing need to build and support avenues for people to enter the workforce at many different occupational levels, such as from basic hospitality jobs to advanced occupations in biotechnology and drone technologies.

The proposed project will significantly expand the opportunities for education and employment for a large segment of an evolving workforce, including those that are in the noncredit system but for whom a connection and process to moving on to for-credit opportunities are either opaque or disconnected. 

The range of programs available in noncredit matches the range of programs in the for credit system—in fact the pathways are clear. Yet, as long ago as 2006, the California Academic Senate recognized that these programs remain nonaligned. By improving that alignment, the number of potential employees for middle-skilled jobs increases significantly, which will, in turn, impact Orange County’s regional economic health and stability. 

The 2014-2105 Orange County Workforce Indicators Report (conducted by the OC Business Council and the OCWIB) points this out: that the alignment of K-12, Adult Education and Community Colleges – and on to the CS and UC systems – is critical to Orange County’s economic climate.  The county’s increasing education and wage inequality is matched by an economy based equally on entry-level hospitality jobs and high-end technology jobs especially in IT and Healthcare. In addition, needs for education in areas traditionally associated with noncredit (ESL and short-term employment training for examples) are rapidly increasing as well. The result is heightened need for connecting all educational pathways to meet both the polls of the region’s labor market needs.

The regional goals of OC businesses and workforce development organizations goals as outlined in supporting data and plans align closely with the outcomes this proposal: enhanced industry-valued certificates – many of which apply directly to the most common occupations in the region --associate degrees, applied bachelor’s degrees, and/or third-party credentials, all leading to Increased longer-term employment at higher wages. The region needs job seekers and a prepared workforce with the necessary skills and credentials in: Accounting and other professional and administrative services occupations; Automotive Technology and other technical services related occupations; Nursing and other healthcare fields such Pharmacy Technology; Culinary Arts and other Retail, Hospitality and Tourism; multiple areas of Information Technology; and Biotechnology and other emerging industries such as those associated with Drone Technologies.","The Initiative answers the immediate needs for enhancing the partnerships and processes that will allow for the most effective transitions from noncredit offerings to credit programs. 

The 2015 Adult Education Regional Planning Process Report jointly produced by the California Department of Education and the California Community College Chancellor’s Office made one fundamental problem explicit:  

“While AB 86 has re-energized adult education and initiated developing close collaboration at the regional level that results in seamless pathways for students between adult education programs and into college or the workforce, unprecedented collaboration, much work remains … the adult education system was complex, confusing, and divided…there was recognition of the need for greater collaboration and innovation, resources were dwindling and programs struggled simply to meet the growing demand for their services…(there is) continuing weakness and inconsistency in regional coordination and collaboration, both between the K-12, Adult and community college providers and with other community partners, including employers….a LAO A 2011 survey by the LAO found that almost half (48 percent) of community college respondents reported that there was no coordination with adult schools in the alignment of student pathways …”

According to a 2012-2103 analysis of Adult education Enrollment in Orange County, less than 15% of the total need was met. Such a gap between need and supply can be reduced, at least in part, by the development – as the 2015 report recommends—of more robust partnerships and the alignment of not only courses but efforts, goals and resources. This Initiative directly responds to the need for creating a system of collaboration and communication. This is best achieved by establishing a sustainable funded effort to bridge systems and processes, and identify and act on opportunities for the benefit of students though alignment.




","The program directly responds to the following Orange County Regional Priorities:

1. Improve Job and Career Readiness through opportunities for students for enhanced work-based learning, apprenticeships and internships.

2. Increased professional development and contract opportunities for faculty and the creation of a “Regional Job and Career Developer.""

3. Creating a virtuous and sustainable system for students in the noncredit system to enter into the community college for-credit with it's expanded opportunities in all these areas.

4. Work to align and leverage resources between the regional community college system and other educational, workforce and economic development organizations such as the K-12 system, Workforce Development Boards, Chambers of Commerce, Orange County Business Council and others.

5. Creating new partnerships needed for seamless pathways including K-14 and employers. This goal cannot be achieved without collective effort among many organizations.

6. Create and implement more efficient career pathways from high school to college to employment. This can be accomplished by reducing redundancy, examining and improving the processes between the systems, and improving-- by sharing-- the options with faculty and most importantly, students.

7. Establish and share protocols, methods and best practices for collaboration and cooperation within Orange County. This can be done through scalable partnerships between all educational providers in Orange County.

"The purpose of the Regional Data Enhancement Initiative is to significantly improve access to relevant data including but not limited to LMI and other quantitative and qualitative information from multiple sources, and to expand the capability of analysis of that information specific to Orange County educational and workforce and economic development system.  This expansion of the current resources will have an important impact on the ability of regional stakeholders to make timely decisions and plan accurately and efficiently. Regional Data Enhancement will: add personnel and subcontracted research partners to the current LAOCRC as part of a common Data Center; 
allow the Center of Excellence Director to better identify current and future Skills Gaps, employment trends; uncover opportunities for the alignment of curriculum and planning; provide additional insights and recommendations specifically focused on Orange County and its unique regional workforce and economic development system. The addition of new research capabilities will not only supplement current activities but will extend them through innovative approaches and the inclusion of partners as sources of untapped information.

This Regional Data Enhancement Initiative aligns very closely with the Strong Workforce Recommendations in several categories beyond Workforce Data and Outcomes. It will improve regional coordination, provides tools and guidance for the development of new curricula directly responsive to the needs of students, faculty and employers, and even provide information on the best ways to allocate funding to increase the effective use of leveraged resources.
","The effective development of responsive programs requires data and colleges and their partners have continuously and exponentially increasing demands for timely LMI and other information to guide decisions and plans.  This demand will not decrease; in fact it will expand as future funding becomes even more dependent on the documentation of performance on many levels. An efficient response to this ongoing challenge is to add personnel and other resources to current capabilities.

The Regional Data Enhancement Initiative will expand the ability of the current Los Angeles and Orange County Center of Excellence Director to: research and analyze Labor Market Information and other quantitative and qualitative information from multiple sources; identify current and future Skills Gaps and employment trends; uncover opportunities for the alignment of curriculum and planning; provide additional insights and recommendations specifically focused on Orange County and its unique regional workforce and economic development system; and conduct and disseminate more in-depth and specialized analysis in a more timely manner.  

The addition of research capabilities will not only supplement current activities but will extend them through innovative approaches and the inclusion of partners as sources of untapped information. These partners will include (but are not limited to): Local Workforce Development Boards, Adult Education Providers, Economic Development Organizations, Employer Groups, Local Governmental Representatives. 

In addition, this Initiative will allow for the creation of a joint Data Center in cooperation with the Los Angeles Region’s efforts. The advantage of this is that more resources will be leveraged for the purposes of having data on two counties in one region as well as providing avenues for county, region and even college specific analysis. 

The collaborative sharing of information will significantly lead to ensuring that college efforts align with those of other organizations (such as those above): data becomes a mechanism for the creation of mutually beneficial cooperation (and building regional coordination). It will also provide enhanced useful and actionable data for decision-making, evolve more accurate measures of outcomes and support an ecosystem of information sharing.

","Orange County’s labor market is very complex with a wide range of occupations, from entry-level RHIT jobs, to a variety of middle-skilled jobs in the service, administrative and technical sectors to more highly skilled occupations in information technology, biotechnology and healthcare. The Orange County economy has been able to not only survive the recent recession it has rebounded by diversifying its economy even further. However, and perhaps paradoxically, economic and wage inequality has increased as has the overall cost of living, sometimes significantly so.  In such a complex workforce and employment and economic and technological environment, the need for accurate just-in-time data drawn from a wide variety of sources in addition to traditional LMI becomes even more critical.

In addition, there are significant differences between the economies and workforce demographics of Los Angeles and Orange counties. There is considerable variation both within and across these counties, a variation that will require additional resources to fully analyze and understand with the needed sophistication. The labor markets in both counties and across the entire LACR region are rapidly evolving. Regional economic and workforce development agencies such as the Orange County Workforce Development Board, the Orange County Business Council, the Orange County Department of Education and committed employer organizations all confirm this: Orange County is likely to transformational change (some planned, some not) over the next five years. If the community colleges are to predict and respond to these changes will require additional information and insights.
","Better data means better analysis; better analyses means better decisions; better decisions lead to tangible benefits to student through the entire K-14 system which leads, in turn, to employment and economic growth. Providing additional funding for Data Enhancement will answer three immediate needs (the most critical among several): collecting and analyzing data specific to Orange County which fundamentally different from Los Angeles; expanding the resources to ensure that data is available quickly to regional leadership faced with the challenge of answering the challenges of a rapidly changing region and; enforcing collaboration between all regional stakeholders by using common sets of data and conclusions for long-term planning efforts.
","Orange County Regional Priorities:

1.	Improve data collection and analysis in order to better make decisions and measure outcomes at the regional level as a method of improving “Local Data Accountability”: this proposal is a direct response to this need.

2.	Improve Job and Career Readiness through opportunities for students for enhanced work-based learning, apprenticeships and internships, increased professional development and contract opportunities for faculty and the creation of a “Regional Job and Career Developer”: improved data capabilities will provide additional information on career and labor market needs which will be invaluable in identifying the most  productive opportunities listed above.

3.	Work to align and leverage resources between the regional community college system and other educational and workforce and economic development organizations such as the K-12 system, the Workforce Development Boards, Chambers of Commerce, the Orange County Business Council and others: the data will become one of the tools for better aligning the efforts and planning of regional stakeholders.

4.	Create and implement more efficient career pathways from high school to college to employment: better data and associated analysis will inform the efforts and decisions around career pathways.

5.	Align “Vertical Sectors” in addition to “Horizontal” community college efforts with community college champions as “Vertical Sector Leaders”: this data will help these Vertical Sector Leaders identify evolving opportunities and occupations in addition to supporting and justifying further innovative collaborations.

6.	Establish and share protocols, methods and best practices for collaboration and cooperation within Orange County: again, data will be a tool for enhanced and productive partnerships as a powerful decision tool. Stronger information means stinger partnerships.

"The purpose of CTE Professional Development and Mentoring project is to develop, promote and implement a regional CTE faculty development program including expanded and innovative continuing education, professional development and mentorship.  The impact of enhancing faculty skills, knowledge and abilities through both training and peer-to-peer mentoring and support will have far-reaching impact including improved instruction, student retention, completion and success but – as importantly for CTE students in particular – improved skills and the likelihood of employment. 

","Ongoing professional development in all its forms is increasingly important: faculty will need, now more than ever, to keep up to date on skills which directly respond to the exponential changes in technology, employer needs, economic trends. Creating a regional approach to professional development is not only more efficient; it also allows for greater connection to local and regional employers, businesses, employers and other workforce and economic development organizations. It is also an innovative opportunity to provide joint learning experiences for instructors from the K-12, Adult Education and Community Colleges systems—a method to alignment Career Pathways and improve the quality of instruction through the entire education system.

While there are initiatives already underway (for example, through the efforts of Deputy Sector Navigators and Adult Basic Education Programs) there is significant opportunity to expand the availability and quality of professional development for CTE faculty. What would be most beneficial is to “regionalize” the approach to the educational opportunities for educators themselves – and provide opportunities for the involvement of employers in the regional advising. 

The Project would also be an opportunity to build on and create new strategies for enhancing faculty participation in professional development opportunities. In addition, the initiative would support a “Regional Champion” for professional development, expanding current methods and partners while building new – innovative and perhaps unprecedented-- ones.

The Regional Champion will also take the lead in identifying potential peer mentors for faculty and for creating the necessary connections to make mentoring possible. Some of the mentoring will extend beyond the home colleges of the faculty members; some mentor/mentee pairs will be from different colleges, districts and -- if deemed valuable-- across disciplines, programs and departments.

The effort is also aligned to other regional projects including professional development concerning the non-credit systems, stakeholders and opportunities for greater alignment with community college for-credit programs.


","The Orange County Region's Labor Market is very complex and diverse -- with clusters of labor market in low-(such as RHIT),  middle-skilled (Administrative and Technical) and high-skilled occupations (in areas such as Healthcare, IT, Drone Technology and Biotechnology). Orange County is also undergoing rapid economic growth driven, at least in part, by the expansion of high industries into the region and a county-wide shared effort to make Orange County a ""technology and innovation hub"" for the country. Along with this economic and technological evolution comes a need for CTE instructors to understand not only what ""excellence in instruction"" is but to also see the broadest implications of the future for their disciplines, stakeholders, partners and (most importantly) students. A diversity in labor markets requires a diversity in approaches, foundational knowledge, skills and abilities and tools and this proposed project will support CTE faculty as they learned these and incorporate into their varied roles.
","By providing: up to date professional development for a wide range of CTE faculty so they can respond to the needs of students, stakeholders, employers and partners across an entire region. The creation of a regional approach and an associated position is: an effective and efficient way to share region-specific knowledge; build a common skills base for all CTE faculty; align current and future efforts and investments in a radically changing technological, economic and workforce climate; and provide a ""systems"" approach -- much needed -- to identifying opportunities and provide responses to them.

The PD will focus on critical CTE issues:  the development of curriculum both noncredit and credit (which aligns closely with the Region's proposed Seamless Pathways from Non-credit to For-Credit Initiative), Program Development, Program Revitalization, best practices for Program Advisory Groups (both Regional and Local), and best practices on how to conduct  DACUMs with Industry.  ","The Initiative will meet the following Regional Priorities:
Enhancing the Job and Career Readiness of students by providing faculty with knowledge of the full opportunities available as they transition from noncredit to for-credit courses, certificates and degrees. This can better aid students in the decision associated with the classes they take, their educational and career pathways and other avenues for seamless transitions
Improving the skills, knowledge and abilities of faculty through timely and regionalized professional development
Aligning community college efforts with other initiatives and leverage resources from Adult Basic Education, WIOA-focused organizations and others – the effort will serve as a mechanism to convene stakeholders with similar interests and goals
Developing, improving, making more efficient and clarifying pathways from High School to Community College to Careers
Building “Vertical Sectors over Horizontal Community Colleges” through alignments led by community college champion. The professional development of these Vertical Sector Leaders will enhance their effectiveness and value
Establishing protocols and identifying best practices to improve collaboration will be included in the professional development and will be shared throughout the region

"The increased utilization of the NETLAB+ system throughout the California Community College system in single and multiple college applications has proven to be advantageous to many students, faculty and college’s CTE per student costs. There is a large library of existing curriculum available in computer science, IT, Cyber Security, IoT and other technologies most of which is state-of the art and much of the foundational curriculum is provided free through the NSF for instructor use. However, valid concerns for quality of service, reliability, down time and a consistent pricing ( grant fundraising ) with the Do It Yourself or multi-campus based systems have emerged. The SCCRC seeks to review vendor bids for a cloud based service that can host the NETLAB+ environment or can offer similar proven features and content of the NETLAB+ product but is also more reliable and cost effective. The scale and increasing complexity of of providing this service to multiple colleges suggest a professional hosting solution selected by a robust and comprehensive RFP process is appropriate.","The utilization of Virtual Labs (Net Lab+) for teaching allows students to access on-line labs 24/7 to complete assignments. Without the barrier for ""lab time"", student enrollment in ICT related CTE courses will increase. In addition, there are cost savings per college for hardware and software demands in classrooms. There are two phases to this process - phase one is being addressed in this submission. A Request for Proposal (RFP)  will be designed to  address each colleges initial demand for virtual lab usage. The depth of the discussion will include ICT and CIS lab requirements initially although virtual labs can be used by multiple disciplines.","The utilization of Virtual Labs (Net Lab+) for teaching allows students to access on-line labs 24/7 to complete assignments. Without the barrier for ""lab time"", student enrollment in ICT related CTE courses will increase. Courses offered on Net Lab are align with Industry Recognized Certifications which are in-demand by employers throughout the region.","This proposal requests funding to research and write the RFP followed by review and selection 
reccomendation.  The RFP Development process includes three phases.

1)   Market and needs assessment,
2)   RFP Draft development and approval,
3)   Release of RFP and review of the responses.

It is understood that the requested scope of this project is regional; however, the economies of 
scale that would achieve the best pricing and sustainability will be achieved by a multi regional 
collaboration RFP. 

This is a Phase approach solution for the region
","The South Central Coast Region identified virtual labs which support cyber security education as a priority for the region."
"Several colleges are either considering the implementation of new course catalog technologies, while several colleges in the LA/OC region are already using CourseLeaf. The proposed project would consolidate and align these efforts in Orange County (and potentially in Los Angeles County). In addition, a shared CourseLeaf-generated web site with information sourced directly from college catalogs can provide much needed information for students on courses, certificates and degrees leading to Career Pathways – data that would be valuable to business, industry and regional partners.
 
CourseLeaf reaches into a college's ERP for course and program information and generates a web-based catalog. Implementing the use of this technology to all the colleges in Orange County would generate a common website displaying a regional program matrix with very high accuracy and automatic annual updates. The technology is flexible enough that it could serve as the foundation for additional uses across the region over time with the input of the colleges. The project would be an opportunity for all four Community College Districts within Orange County to use a common, mutually beneficial database.
 
Students as well as faculty, workforce and economic development organizations and employers from across the entire region would benefit.

The proposed project would require the creation of a regional team to support the full adoption of the CourseLeaf system and the SWP funding would supplement the use of General Funds – and create a net saving over the college-by-college or District-by-District implementation. The direct input and involvement of colleges and Districts collaboratively will increase the likelihood of success; reduce the risks associated with siloed adoption; and provide a practical demonstration of the benefits of this cooperation (which can be shared as a best practice across the state).  The shared effort will also be a mechanism for convening regional stakeholders around an important – and actionable – issue.
","Currently, the college catalogs across Orange County are unique to each institution in format, layout, and approach to content. The catalogs, and also the college web sites, are not consistent, can be  complicated and are unaligned. Students need online access to better explore available offerings within and across Districts and Colleges-- and web sites and catalogs that enhance their ability to make clear decisions. Employers need to be able to easily find programs at the community colleges that meet their hiring and workforce training needs. College CTE administrators need a method of accurately submitting their college and program information to a central database with as little time and effort as possible. The needs this proposal addresses are: for easy access for students to the information they need to make career pathways, course, certificate and degree decisions; a comparable and consistent format to allow for decisions without having to search between multiple format catalogs; easier access to web-based information and resources for employers, students, and college administrators through a single portal; and to provide consistency of and easier access to course and program information in the region with the result of a more coherent, effective and efficient effort.  ","Orange County's Labor Market is divergent and exponentially changing.  Clusters around RHT, Healthcare, IT and others have many emerging occupations as well as those traditionally associated with these sectors. Orange County's labor market is bifurcated: hospitality, retail and tourism (for examples) on one end of a skills spectrum and HealthCare and IT. As such, employers require a workforce that can meet the increased for both ends of the spectrum. In addition, the county's employers, WDB, K-14 system and other stakeholders have a common concern: how to attract and retain are working collaboratively to expand middle-skilled  jobs and  the attract the talent to fill those jobs. The growth of the County depends on meeting a very broad set of employers and goals and as such, this requires a workforce prepared with a wider range of skills and abilities than many other regions. There are ten colleges in Orange County each serving sometimes dramatically different student populations. For a student to succeed in Orange County's complex economic/technological/political/workforce climate, they need to be able to access information quickly on available courses across all these colleges. The economic climate is complicated and fluid; the web-based information on how students can find opportunities needs to be simple and consistent.","By providing a single, web-based portal for a common ""catalog"" of programs for all students and employers in Orange County. It is a cost-effective solution and, in itself, a mechanism for allowing students to improve their success in enrollment, career pathways and eventual employment.","Orange County Regional Priorities:

Develop better data to order to make decisions and measure outcomes at the regional level as a method of improving “Local Data Accountability”: by providing common analytics cross region on student access to catalogs, course enrollment and shared courses for program alignment and improvement

Improve Job and Career Readiness through opportunities for students for enhanced work-based learning, apprenticeships, internships for students, increased professional development and contract opportunities for faculty and the creation of a “Regional Job and Career Developer”: project could support the development of a common shared source of information for both students and employers on opportunities such as these

 Create and implement more efficient career pathways from high school to college to career development: common catalog would provide clearer information on available courses, certificates and degrees across entire region, allowing for students to make better choices to align their education with long-term career goals.

Establish and shared protocols, methods and best practices for collaboration and cooperation within Orange County on how to collaborate better: by providing a valuable opportunity for collaboration between all the region’s Colleges and Districts around a common, shared challenge with direct benefit to students.

"Coastline Community College will host the Los Angeles and Orange County Regional NetLabs project. Colleges throughout the region colleges will maintain ownership of their NetLabs equipment; this equipment would be housed at the Coastline site and all of the participating colleges (whether they donated equipment or not) would use the virtual lab services on a minimal annual fee basis to cover the ongoing network administrative support, replacement, and maintenance/operation of the NetLabs system. The pooling of equipment would allow access to a larger number of colleges.

","The demand for trained IT professionals is growing and community colleges must find a way to offer training to an increasing number of students wanting to work in this field. A virtual lab like NetLabs will increase opportunities for students to enter the workforce through enhanced training. The ability to offer a multitude of classes without investing in expensive lab equipment is a major benefit of using a virtual lab system. 

NETLAB+ gives colleges the ability to create remote labs with equipment they don’t typically have in an on-campus physical lab. The lab setups are made up of one to eight virtual computers in pods.

Other regions have already piloted the implementation of NetLabs. For example, the North/Far North NETLAB+ hub currently includes more than 1,400 virtual computers.

Expanding the availability of NetLabs will allow for students to complete industry- recognized and valued certifications. 
To have a single coordinated NetLabs hub for Orange County is a significant way to reduce redundancy and with it costs, increase the efficiency of use of resources, and provide coordination of instruction across many colleges in the region.
","According to the Orange County Business Council (OCBC) and the Orange County Workforce Investment Board (OCWIB)’s
2015-2016 Orange County Workforce Indicators Report:

“The average “IT salary is $88,458, about $35,000 more than county’s annual average. The integration of business and technical skills in the 21st century Orange County economy means that occupations that bridge business and IT are rapidly becoming major drivers of economic growth in the county. California’s Employment Development Department recently reported that two of the top ten occupations with the fastest job growth in Orange County were in the IT sector. Orange County must continue to supply its IT industry with qualified workers… In order to remain economically competitive and prosperous, Orange County must continue to provide high-multiplier industry clusters with the tools they need to continue their growth. The Information Technology sector, for example, provides much higher wages to its employees than the county average. Losing jobs in this sector not only limits both the county’s ability to remain competitive in the IT field, but also stunts county residents’ ability to find high-wage positions. This becomes especially relevant with clusters such as Information Technology and Biotechnology, which both expand the county’s technology base and establish it as a center for innovation…Information security analysts are another bright light for employment growth. Predicted to grow by 43.5 percent, this occupation provides an average salary of $93,088, much higher than the county average. The widespread adoption of technology in the workplace leaves many businesses vulnerable to cyber-attacks, which in turn increases the demand for information security analysts.


","NETLAB+ provides an environment through which students may schedule and complete lab exercises for Information Technology courses from the classroom, from home, or anywhere with Internet access.
The NETLAB+ system will be installed and administered at each of the participating colleges. The colleges will control class offerings, instructor accounts, student accounts and configuration of both virtual machines and real gear for instructional access. NETLAB+ includes a wide variety of curriculum content options.
Existing NETLAB+ curriculum includes:
•	CompTIA A+
•	CompTIA Network+
•	CompTIA Security+
•	Ethical Hacking
•	Windows Administration
•	Windows 7
•	VMware vSphere

","The use of the NetLabs virtual environment will allow the community colleges to deliver high quality courses to students in the IT disciplines where and when they need the hands-on practice."
"The CyberPatriot Initiative proposal is to plan and implement an innovative program to meet the critical need for developing cyber-skills and awareness for K-12 students as a direct response to increased employment and wages earned for students in this high demand field. Through CyberPatriot competitions –and the collaborative learning that comes with them -- students will be exposed to the basics of cybersecurity and its applications. 
","There is a profound need to increase the cyber workforce in California and across the country.  The CyberPatriot competitions prepare students with fundamental networking/cyber skills and the ability to work as a team under pressure.","This proposal provides the foundational cyber and soft skills needed by industry to meet the gap of a highly trained cyber workforce.  Students competing in the CyberPatriot program have the skills to move into an entry level position in the Cyberworkforce and then progress on to higher level skill training at the community colleges.     ","Coastline is proposing $350,000 of the regional funds to sponsor CyberPatriot competition activities at the current three colleges and increase to four colleges during the next competition season. Expenses to be covered for these competitions include Coordinator (+Benefits), 25 Mentors to help teams on a weekly basis, K-12 teacher/coach stipends, CyberPatriot Team Registration (50 high schools, 25 middle schools), food for the events, marketing, bus transportation for high school students, and the design and implementation of a competition scoring engine and practice scenarios.


","ICT is one of the defined regional priorities for the region.  This project will increase enrollments in the ICT Networking/Cybersecurity disciplines and ultimately provide an increased number of qualified networking/cybersecurity specialists ready for employment in Orange County and California as a whole."
"The Regional Biotechnology Education Partnership is designed to educate technician-level professionals with the skills required to earn immediate gainful employment in the fields of technology that utilize the science of biology.

"The Automotive Technology Collaborative Project Work will create a collaborative to enhance the portability and comparability of Automotive Technology programs for students and employers across the region. 

The Collaborative will create showcases, competitions, and joint projects in support of the “car culture” of Orange County. Determining the strengths and growth areas for each program will help focus regional resources to build unique programs that better meets the needs of the students and employers, more effectively markets the five Automotive Technology programs in the region and increases awareness and enrollments for each of them.


","Develop program awareness to the region by coordinating brand marketing, curriculum alignment, and faculty development.","Over the next five years, LMI data suggests that there will be an increase of 10.5% increase in jobs in the area.  The median hourly labor rate is $19.76 per hour.  Both the increase and rate are approximately 25-30% higher than the national average.  Industry advisors have reported that they cannot find enough trained automotive technicians and would be ready to hire significant numbers if the supply was available.  Identified employers include new and used auto dealers, independent auto repair facilities, and specialty service providers  such as oil change, tires, body and paint, and other services.","The Collaborative will create showcases, competitions, and joint projects in support of the “car culture” of Orange County. Determining the strengths and growth areas for each program will help focus regional resources to build unique programs that better meets the needs of the students and employers, more effectively markets the five Automotive Technology programs in the region and increases awareness and enrollments for each of them.  Further, the collaborative with develop stackable curriculum which can be achieved at the regional colleges that have automotive programs.","This proposal intends to develop and coordinate automotive training between the five colleges that offer automotive technology within its curriculum.  Ideally, the partnership will develop certificates that can be quickly attained and used in attaining employment and/or improve current skills.  A curriculum inventory will be determined so that repetition in advance instruction is minimized between the colleges.  Further, curriculum will be identified as to whether offerings should be credit or non-credit based.  In order to build community awareness, the partnership will be working on developing branding and marketing materials."
"The Region and Sector Specific Initiative is an integrated effort to: create and implement a region-wide marketing strategy which matches and build on college- and program-specific efforts and investments;  pilot and expand the marketing of the already successful Business Information Worker Initiative; convene a Regional Counselor Conference to share common practices and materials to attract a wider range of students to CTE students; and finally to add information on the economic impact of the region as a whole and college-by-college to more effectively – and with greater legitimacy and justification – the value of the colleges to stakeholders across the region across the State.","This proposal responds to five interrelated regional needs: creating of an overall regional marketing strategy and it's implementation; creating an integrated marketing effort which brings together Regional, College-specific, sector- specific and even program-specific marketing, outreach and promotion efforts to increase student awareness of CTE and enrollments; to implement model marketing programs focused on career pathways important in Orange County; to capture and use economic impact information to supplement the LMI and other data traditionally used to evaluate college and program performance; and to provide additional opportunities for career professionals, counselors and others from the K-14 system to share information, best practices and marketing/promotion plans, strategies and efforts. ","The Orange County Region needs to increase enrollment and currently expand it's labor market in three critical areas-- RHT, IT (including Administrative Services) and Healthcare -- and, in the future, Biotechnology, Advanced Manufacturing and drone-related occupations. This proposal addresses in one way or another all of these to preparing the workforce: by increasing overall the number of students entering and completing CTE programs in priority by providing information on opportunities in these sectors; by expanding the skills and knowledge bases of counselors, stakeholders and others on emerging careers that will immediately meet labor market needs; by increasing the number of students entering into and completing programs related to business information; and, finally, by providing economic information that gives more a more complete overview of what labor market needs currently are-- to activate shared efforts to meet those needs.","The are many interconnected reasons to justify the development and implementation of a comprehensive regional marketing plan for Orange Community Colleges and their partners. The rebranding of “Career Technical Education” as a desirable pathway is an essential part of college and regional success. Coordination between colleges and the region as a whole must align with the broader branding efforts currently underway by the California Community College Chancellor’s Office and – if possible – leverage the resources that both can contribute. Coordination will lead to both higher efficiency and higher effectiveness. 

However, while there are advantages to a statewide rebranding, the consistent, standardized messages associated with that must be adapted to region-specific characteristics, such as priority and emerging sectors, the unique programs that each college has to offer, and the interests and investments of partners.  

Enhanced involvement of all regional and local stakeholders – businesses and their representatives, workforce and economic development agencies, government, educational organizations, non-profits and so on – will add to the potential for lasting impact. A truly effective campaign will also build on the longstanding efforts of others in the region, such as Deputy Sector Navigators, parent teacher organizations, K-14 counselors – even alumni--ensuring the biggest bang for each marketing buck.

A joint approach like this – from system-wide to regionally focused to college and sector-specific will require additional staffing and shared investments. There is a clear need for a regional coordinator who can accelerate the implementation of a regional plan and ensure its coherence and maximum effectiveness.

Likewise, there is a related need to significantly expand the marketing pipelines for getting information to students; social media, television, radio and even print and posted materials must become part of the marketing initiative.
 
Most importantly, a marketing campaign will benefit current and future students. For just one example: early awareness of the options offered by community colleges increases both enrollment and eventual employment for students.

Some of the most important elements of a marketing plan include:

Identifying regional marketing efforts and determining their impact
Engaging the eventual targets of the marketing, such as parents, students and employers – at the earliest stages of planning, as well as involving community college leadership to help consistently share a message
Creating a meaningful and powerful definition of “Career Technical Education” that resonates with our communities

This proposal answers all the identified needs by: 
1. funding the creation and implementation of a region-wide  marketing strategy which also answers college and program-specific needs; 
2.creation of a venue conference for all regional counselors, career advisors and others form the K-14 system plus stakeholders to share efforts and ideas around the promotion of CTE and career pathways opportunities; 
3. the advancement of an already successful program -- the Business Information Worker -- across the region; and funding a more detailed economic impact statement for the Region describing in greater detail the true value of CTE and the colleges in Orange County; 
4. and the funding of regional economic impact studies which will include both a total regional impact and a college-by-college study to identify the relative impacts (as a tool for enhanced decision-making and other uses).

One element of the marketing effort will include the implementation of the BIW in Orange County. Currently, almost 70% of California’s community colleges and seven of Orange County’s nine colleges have opted-into The Business Information Worker (BIW) Statewide Initiative. The BIW is already a branded pathway that provides students with training that is current – and validated by California placement agencies -- providing knowledge and skills needed by a significant percentage of Orange County’s labor market and workforce.

In Orange County, Office and Administrative Support has the highest number of jobs at almost 160,00 with a projected 4,167 openings per year until 2020. Most of these jobs do not pay wages adequate to live in Orange County; however, completion of a certificate such as the BIW (especially by Skills Builders who do not intend to complete a degree) can increase wages by 28% within two years and, in some cases, over 35%. The BIW – even more broadly promoted than now – can help attract and retain students for a certificate with a significant impact on wages.

The proposed BIW Region-wide marketing effort will expand the visibility of BWI options to students through an innovative approach scalable statewide. A BIW portal will give students easy access to information on available courses; professional networking opportunities; and how to get certified and hired in the region. It will also provide links to placement agencies as routes to employment.

The BIW program, curricula and website is already in place as is a pilot marketing campaign. BIW is a flagship program that can be mass marketed and when it fully is will generate significant amounts of FTE’s – and meet the SWP goals of “More and Better CTE” and many of the SWP recommendations. BIW already has regional pre-approval and eight faculty have become champions in the promotion of BIW in Los Angeles and Orange Counties.

The full implementation of the plan would include: Outreach (via radio and WDB participation for example), Capture (e.g. through the innovative use of a Call Center for follow-up); Regional Recruitment; the creation and dissemination of a wide range of promotional materials and social media; and a further piloting and, more importantly, expansion of the resources and impact of the effort across Orange County. In addition, the BIW Initiative will include the development of an accelerated enrollment and registration process to encourage cohort recruitment along with two years continuous engagement for student retention.

In addition the Regional and Sector Specific Marketing would include an aggregate regional Economic Impact Study (EIS) for the nine colleges of OCRC as well as individual studies for each college of the OCRC will be completed. An economic impact analysis and an investment analysis will be conducted as well as a full profile of OCRC will also be provided to place the impact and investment analyses in context. The economic impact analysis will examine the direct and indirect multiplier effects that occur as the colleges associated with OCRC and its employees, visitors, and students spend money in the region, as well as the economic benefits generated by students who are living and working within the local economy. Over 1,100 industries, 16 demographic cohorts, and 750 occupations will be characterized. The investment analysis will weigh the benefits generated by OCRC and its students against the associated costs of supporting and attending OCRC. The investment analysis consists of three main components: the student, the taxpayer, and the societal perspective.

Orange County has conducted three three successful Counselor conferences and fourteen K-12 CTE districts have they all expressed support for this continuing and improving these conferences. There is a great need to engage the community college counselor world to a much deeper level in the conference.  There are significant needs to improve communication and mutual engagement in the entire K-14 system especially between those in counselor roles. The regional Orange County Department of Education has taken on a leadership role; this proposal will better align OCDE’s efforts with those of the community colleges and other stakeholders. In addition, collaboration will create 
a countywide counselor organization.  The lead, with input from the individual colleges will play a full partnership role for planning the conference with K-14 groups. Additional efforts will also include joint professional development for counselors, faculty and administrators – plus interested and involved others--specifically with a CTE focus for college counselors.

"California community colleges are required to review and revise career and technical education programs every two years to ensure that they align to the region’s labor market needs.  Although this may sound like an easy requirement, conducting a thorough and realistic assessment of current market conditions is a daunting, time-consuming task.  To address this challenge, Los Rios is going to contract with Valley Vision to develop an approach for partnering with industry that aligns industry needs with local community college training programs. 

Los Rios will adopt an innovate model, developed by the Bay Area Community College Consortium.  The model is designed for partnering and exchanging information in a way that mutually benefits both college and business partners.  Valley vision will lead this effort with the following responsibilities: identify and recruit industry partners and associations to participate; develop objectives and action-oriented agendas for the convenings; summarize findings; and lead implementation efforts.

"Los Rios colleges have very few services that directly connect graduating students with employment opportunities.  To increase the number of CTE graduates that find employment in their field of study, Los Rios will partner with the Sacramento Employment and Training Agency (SETA) to sponsor a part-time SETA job developer at each campus.  The job developer will recruit employers to hire graduating CTE students. Primary responsibilities will include business presentations at various events sponsored by local chambers of commerce and other industry associations, cold/warm calling, webinars, innovative and direct marketing, coordinating interviewing/hiring activities and events, and tracking employment outcomes.","Many employers are not aware of the wide range of CTE programs offered by Los Rios colleges, nor do they know how to recruit graduating students.

"To educate Agriculture students in the field of livestock reproduction.  Introducing students to equine and bovine reproductive technologies, laboratory techniques, and other assisted reproductive biotechnology procedures. 
This proposal also seeks to improve and enhance agriculture instruction in the Woodland Community College (WCC) service area that spans the North Far North regions that includes Greater Sacramento (Yolo County), Northern Inland  (Colusa County) and Northern Coastal (Lake County) regions.  It will entail expansion of the WCC agriculture program to include Colusa and Lake Counties, hiring faculty and staff to support curriculum development, instruction and oversight, and purchasing equipment and supplies for this purpose.","This proposal will address the need for educating Agriculture students in the field of livestock reproduction, biotechnology practices, safe livestock handling procedures, and breeding facility operation.  Understanding of livestock reproductive physiology is essential to managing a successful livestock production operation.  Genetic improvement and selection can be dramatically improved in a short period of time when a manager has the knowledge to incorporate biotechnology practices such as embryo transfer, artificial insemination, and hormone manipulation.  Agriculture students will learn how to utilize these biotechnology techniques while applying knowledge of livestock reproductive anatomy and physiology in both cattle and horses.  These skills will help Agriculture students to gain employment in the livestock production and/or biotechnology fields.  These skills are beneficial to Farmers, Ranchers, Agriculture Managers, Animal Breeders, Farming Supervisors, Farm Agents.  Knowledge of safe handling practices, breeding facility operation and associated farm equipment is also important for Farm Equipment Mechanics. These skills will also help livestock producers to increase their income by improving the quality of their cattle herd or horse genetics.
In concert with its location in a predominantly agricultural environment, WCC has emphasized agricultural instruction in its disciplinary profile. Moreover, Yuba Community College Board of Trustees issued a directive for the College to continue to emphasize agriculture instruction and respond to the needs of local agriculture businesses and high school partners. Recommendations from a 2011 California Community College State-wide Advisory Committee Evaluation Team of Agricultural and Natural Resources discipline experts documented shortcomings in WCC’s ability to fully meet its goals to deliver effective agriculture instruction. There is a strong need to leverage partnership opportunities with local agriculture businesses, including major seed companies: the college faces Agricultural Program challenges requiring curriculum and facility development, including the construction of an industry standard greenhouse to support effective instruction. ","The region around Feather River College tends to be more rural with large livestock operations.  Students who successfully complete the coursework will be prepared to enter the labor market as ranch managers, livestock production managers, breeding operation structural design, farmers, ranchers, agriculture managers, animal breeders, farming supervisors, farm agents and farm equipment mechanics and/or biotechnology fields.  These skills will also help livestock producers to increase their income by improving the quality of their cattle herd or horse genetics.
Labor market information referenced in 2016 in this proposal show profiles of the regions served by WCC that suggest a growing demand for workers in the agricultural sector (Agriculture, Food and Beverage). In the Sacramento region, 2,660 new jobs and projected openings of 7,942 are highlighted; in the Northern Economic Market that includes Colusa, there is a projection for 7,148 new job openings, while the San Francisco Bay Economic Market that includes Lake County projects 22,519 job openings. WCC provides instruction that prepare students for careers inherent in this labor market need; they include farm management, commodity brokers, sales, animal scientists, environmental specialists, food security, agronomists, and plant scientists. While the department currently offers courses in agriculture, sustainable agriculture, environmental horticulture, and plant science, there is a need to assess existing offerings relative to their relevance to the need of the region’s labor market; there is also a need develop new courses or certificates in areas that reflect such labor market need. These can range from certificates that support entry level jobs to those that prepare students for transfer to complete requirements for jobs that require a four year degree.","This proposal meets the identified need by educating Agriculture students in the field of livestock reproduction, biotechnology practices, safe livestock handling procedures, and breeding facility operation. Students will apply the practices and procedures in real-life, hands-on applications by performing semen collection, semen preservation, artificial insemination, embryo collection, embryo transfer, embryo cryopreservation, hormone manipulation, breeding operation design and construction, and practice of safe handling procedures.  If this proposal is awarded, it will be used for the purchase of instructional equipment and site improvements.  Examples of instructional equipment would include laboratory equipment such as liquid nitrogen storage dewars, centrifuge, microscopes, incubator, and veterinary analysis equipment.  Examples of site improvements would be the construction of livestock holding pens, safety improvements to current working facilities, and set up of instructional equipment.  The instructional equipment and site improvements would enable the instruction of safe livestock handling practices and facilitate the instruction of reproduction and biotechnology practices and procedures for both horses and cattle. 
This proposal allows WCC to address resource shortages that have limited our ability to aggressively pursue outreach and instructional efforts for increased enrollment and completion rates and flexible response to the training needs of industry. It allows us to:
•	 meet the recommendations that was suggested by a Statewide team of agriculture experts but stymied by lack of resources;
•	accelerate the development of a modern ag program, including equipment for a green house
•	respond to the development of new courses that will improve agricultural instruction;
•	 allow for the collaborations with high school ag programs;
•	 expand programs in ag mechanics, in conjunction with our Lake County welding program, revise courses and design new certificates. 
•	allow WCC to increase the use of emerging technology in agriculture (use of field testing equipment for soils, plant, surveys);
•	 increase course offerings (day/evening options) to meet the needs of local farmers in Lake and Colusa Counties
•	Align with Seed Industry (UC Davis and Seed Central) 
•	 Increase student degrees/certificates and transfer to CSU/UC 
•	Increase applied laboratory activities with land (ie: Crop studies, plant studies, etc)
The second ag instructor will feature prominently in designing the structure that will allow this proposal to meet the identified needs identified above, including developing new courses and revamping the agriculture curriculum.","Feather River College serves the North far North sector and have been working with the Deputy Sector Navigator of Agriculture, Water and Technology (Heather Kelnhofer at Shasta College).  Agriculture is considered a priority sector.  In September 2014, the Deputy Sector Navigator of Agriculture, Water and Technology for the North Far North Region awarded Feather River College funding for the development and execution of a Baccalaureate Program in Equine and Ranch Management. For almost two years, the college has been working diligently with the grant funds to complete large tasks for the accreditation of the Equine and Ranch Management Bachelor Degree Program such as curriculum development, marketing, and more. Feather River College has requested three grants to fund this project from the Deputy Sector Navigator and was funded for all three.
The North Far North Regional Consortium has identified agriculture as a priority sector in the region and has recognized its role as a key driver of our regional economy. Hence, this proposal aligns with regional efforts to ensure and sustain the important role of this sector through manpower training and the development of a viable and flexible agriculture curriculum.  As WCC expand our associations with local industry  and educational partners through this proposal, we will be mindful of the ethos of regional collaboration by sharing best practices with other colleges and entities in our region by continuing our close working relationships with the DSNs and our regional consortium.

"Utilize curriculum and best practices of the CTE Enhancement Regional Agriculture/Irrigation Project to expand and enhance Precision Agriculture and Irrigation Technology courses in the south valley, specifically College of the Sequoias.  Activities will include 1) collaborative meetings with industry partners, Fresno State University and other regional or state schools; 2) development of a Precision Agriculture Lab and Irrigation Technology Lab; 3) working collaboratively with regional community colleges in creating interest in high school students to this highly technical field of work; 4) ensure connectivity and transfer of courses  to 4-year institutions.","Agriculture is a major economic force in the San Joaquin Valley. Increasing water use efficiency helps ensure a sustainable agro-economic region that supports employment and fiscal stability for those regions. Precision agriculture practices increase crop yields, reduce waste, and improve overall efficiency across all crop areas. ","Current Labor Market Information indicates demand outweighs supply in the region. Completing this proposal promises to increase the number of graduates in impacted programs, directly translating to increased numbers of qualified employees. ","This project will increase and improve educational offerings in Precision Agriculture and Irrigation Technology across multiple San Joaquin Valley colleges. Additionally, appropriate laboratory equipment will enhance relevancy and improve learning by anchoring concepts and content. The development of a workforce educated in agricultural efficiency methods directly and indirectly raises expectations, capacity, and capability across all agricultural areas.

"Hospitality is an extremely important industry in the North Bay. This industry includes hotels, restaurants, wineries, breweries and spas.  Santa Rosa Junior College, Napa Valley College and College of Marin have identified hospitality as an industry where we can come together in collaborative projects that will impact our colleges and result in more CTE instruction, better CTE outcomes, close gaps in program access and meet both sides of the North Bay labor market within the hospitality industry. Strong Workforce Funds will be used to convene faculty and industry, assess and align existing curriculum, create new curriculum with the goal to increase enrollments, completions, employment in the industry and third party certifications. The labor market information as well as local listening posts indicate strong demand for these projects.","Currently, there are more hospitality and culinary jobs than supply can meet.  This is verified by both the data and through participation in such industry/provider partnerships such as the North Bay Hospitality Partnership. The hospitality industry is predicted to experience one of the largest growth in jobs across all sectors in California. ","In 2015, the North Bay had 415 regional completions in hospitality/culinary programs. In 2015, there was an estimated 10,196 annual openings with an average earnings of $34,082 per job. This sector was estimated to increase 9% between 2016 and 2021.","This proposal will identify opportunities for the development of regional strategies to assess existing and align curriculum to industry needs.

"For a number of the Strong Workforce Recommendations, there is economy of scale to do “projects in-common” across all regions.  Existing pilots have informed effective practices for addressing these recommendations.  According to the Strong Workforce Program flowchart, 10% of Regional share allocation can be deployed for Task Force recommendations with attention to: 1) region-wide outreach to employers on CTE by sector for purposes of internship/job placements; 2) region-wide outreach to students/families on career awareness/CTE options; 3) additional data-related needs; and, 4) professional development to streamline curriculum approval.

"In order to obtain information about Los Rios’ career and technical education programs, prospective students must visit all four college websites. This is a cumbersome process that can be daunting for many people.  Rather than requiring prospective students to conduct their own research, Los Rios will develop a webpage that provides information on the 119 different CTE programs offered at each campus.  The website will include information on degrees and certificates offered at each college, labor market information citing the demand, wage data on graduates, and other pertinent information relevant to the career planning process. ","The current process for accessing information about Los Rios community colleges is cumbersome and daunting as it requires viewing each college’s website separately.  Further each college provides somewhat different information about their programs making it difficult to compare programs and identify the most appropriate option based on career goals.  ","This project meets the needs of the region's labor market by increasing the pipeline of workers pursing careers in their field of interest.  This will increase the number of qualified applicants available for open positions.","This investment will give prospective students an online resource to identify, compare, and review the 119 different CTE programs offered throughout the district.  Prospective students will be able to quickly and easily gain access to relevant information needed to develop an education plan.","This proposal addresses the following NFN Regional Consortium priority and goal: ‘Create a sustained public outreach campaign for industry, high school students, counselors, parents, faculty, staff, and the community at large to promote career development and attainment and the value of career technical education.’ By providing a website for prospective students, this investment provides the foundation for developing a social marketing campaign to increase enrollments in CTE programs."
"Students that do not go on to college have limited opportunities to find well-paying jobs and those that choose private institutions are often saddled with insurmountable debt that follows them for a lifetime. This project is designed to nudge high school graduates into community college.  One of the main reasons young people make poor decisions that hinder their career and financial freedom is decision paralysis.  That is when decisions are complex, offer abundant options, and provide delayed feedback, most people either (1) do nothing or (2) make poor, ill-informed decisions.  Well-vetted default options offer a safety net for persons that get stuck in decision paralysis.  

This project includes three elements that create an easy default option for graduating high school seniors, including: 
1.	High school seniors complete the community college applications (state and local), standardized placement assessments, and BOG waiver form at the high school during class time.
2.	Community college counselors conduct individual advising sessions with every graduating senior to develop an education and career plan.
3.	Students and parents are invited to financial aid workshops.
","Education planning is a complex process that hinders some young people from making effective choices about their future, which leads to decision paralysis and fall out between high school graduation and college enrollment.  ","This proposal addresses the needs of the region's labor market by increasing the number of individuals entering the job market with CTE credentials.  ","By reducing the complexity of options and providing a default option, this proposal should increase the number of high school students that enter the community college system after they obtain their diploma.  ","This proposal addresses the following NFN Regional Consortium priority and goal: 'Enhance participation in CTE Career Pathways between K-16' by developing a default option that increases enrollment of students immediately after completing their high school education."
"The focus of the project will be to develop short videos and comprehensive websites for CTE programs at the College.  A comprehensive marketing plan for CTE programs will be developed to guide dissemination of program and LMI data.","This proposal will assist the college with developing CTE program collateral (website and videos) with real time information about the programs.  The videos will be shown not only on the program websites but aired in local community venues (i.e. movie theaters) to expand beyond our traditional marketing efforts.  The materials will be used by outreach staff at high schools and shared with local business and industry groups such as the Valley Industrial Association.","This project meets the needs of the region's labor market by potentially increasing enrollments in CTE courses and programs, thus increasing the pipeline of trained workers.","This investment will provide potential students as well as business/industry with easily accessible information on the CTE courses and programs.  The information provided will help students with decision making related to education and career planning.  The project will also inform individuals who might not have considered the college as a resource for furthering or enhancing the employment skills.","Marketing our regional and local CTE programs was the number on priority established in the regional strategic plan."
"North Bay community colleges are leveraging resources to expand sustainable agriculture, agri-business and Farm to Fork programs.","This proposal seeks to utilize the natural, financial, and educational resources of regional colleges to deliver programming that will help a student with an interest or background in agriculture move into a role of greater responsibility and opportunity as an entrepreneurial-minded professional with a high level of skill in both farm practices and business management.  Students in the region who are considering or already working in farm labor positions may not achieve a level of income to meet all of their needs and could use additional education to take a step to a higher wage or into a new level of responsibility or area of the industry.","This proposal will address need for positions in the Agricultural industry as well as related industries which touch on the skills and knowledge of individuals working in agricultural roles.  The supply regionally for agricultural workers does not meet the demand, largely due to attrition, and LMI from Centers of Excellence does not predict a great deal of growth in the industry.  The demand for individuals with a strong business background and entrepreneurial spirit far exceeds the regional supply, and the regional partners see a marriage of these skills to be an excellent opportunity to match regional resources and labor market need.","This proposal seeks to develop programs which will foster a spirit of innovation in utilizing farming skill and knowledge that bridges methods of organic farming, food safety, business management, and entrepreneurship.  Students who work through this program will develop a diverse skill set which will allow them to develop income opportunities outside of traditional farm labor and hone their abilities to meet changing market needs while also respecting natural resources.","The regional partners have looked to meet the needs identified by the BACCC with regard to the priority for Small Business/Entrepreneur skills training with this regional effort.  The details of BACCC's priority can be read here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5WXrCuXE2RpWTE5emhfZW5mZHc/view?usp=sharing .

"The Yuba College Psychiatric Technician program is a 4 semester and one summer session CTE program.  Currently the program has only one full time faculty member doing the program instruction as well as the program administrative duties. Due to the clinical/lab components of the program, the BVNPT limits the ratio of 15 students to one faculty member, which limits the program to fifteen students every other year as this is a two year program.  There are currently 85 students on the first-come-first-served wait list. The Psych Tech program needs to be doubled to accept a cohort of students annually. The programs has sixteen clinical sites will allow for the doubling of the program without difficulty.  The local and regional workforce vacancies will be helped to be filled by increasing the number of graduates within our region.","1. Currently the waitlist for the program is 85 students which represents about a 6 year wait. As Yuba College is the most northern college with the Psychiatric Technician program, applicants are from Redding to stockton.                                                                                     2. Increasing faculty could potentially allow for out-of-the-area clinical sites so that students will not be required to commute such long distances.                                                                                    3. The local and regional labor market has a very high demand for Psych Techs which are not being currently filled.                                                                                          4.  Student who fail a class and need to remediate, currently have to wait 2 years to re-enter the program which is very detrimental to previous learning.","1. Students who apply for the program are wanting to “better their life”.  Many times students cannot wait to earn a living wage by sitting on a program wait list for up to 6 years.                                            2. The current classroom has the capability to provide distance learning which would be an asset to students traveling long distances to attend the program                                                                               3. Currently, clinical sites are all within the Yuba-Sutter and Chico area. By adding an additional instructor, the program could potentially expand using clinical sites within the students’ area of residence within the region.                                                                                                                                          4. With the increasing high demand for LPT’s within the California Department of Corrections, the California Department of State Hospitals, the local private and county mental health facilities and special needs student school classrooms student will be able to graduate and earn a living wage within 2 years.                                                                                                                 5. Under the current program, starting every other, a student who fails a course has a two year wait for that class to be offered again. This time lapse of two years is a detriment to the students’ previous learning and success. The planned expansion of starting a new cohort annually will allow a student to remediate and re-enter the program quicker, retaining learning in other courses enabling them to be more successful in their academic and employment goals.","Expansion of the Yuba College Psych Tech program would be regionally beneficial. There are only fourteen accredited Psychiatric Technician programs in the state of California. The closest program to Yuba College is in Stockton. Even though our student applicants cover over one-third of the state, coming from Redwood City to Vallejo, the Yuba College Psychiatric Technician program is the smallest in the state due to lack of institutional funding. Currently the waitlist for the program is 85 students which represents about a 6 year wait. Having two full time instructors would be able to double the program accepting 15 students annually. The program must have an additional full time instructor to accomplish any growth. Due to the demand of LPT’s, all of the students are employed prior to graduation in the North Far North region prior to graduation.  100% of all students completing the Yuba College Psych Tech program find employment within their field of study. They are working within the California Department of State Hospitals, Substance Abuse Treatment Facilities, California State Corrections, California State Developmental Centers, County Mental Health Centers, privately owned mental health centers, County School systems, privately owned developmental centers, Sutter Health Facilities, Dignity Health Facilities, Kaiser Hospitals, privately owned hospitals and Psychiatric centers. ","The CTE health care sector is one of the priorities to be addressed within the region.  The local and regional vacancies in the labor market for Psychiatric Technicians is very high and is losing ground due to retirements and openings of new Mental Health and Corrections facilities.  This proposal will be able to double the program size to help fill the local and regional vacancies.   80% of the students are unemployed when entering the program.  Due to the high demand for Psych Techs, most students will be employed prior to graduating allowing them to earn a living wage quickly."
"Provide work-based learning opportunities for community college students. Students will follow cGLP, cGMP, regulations, and technical lab and soft skills while generating “life science laboratory products” for teachers and instructors to use in their classes. 	This is an innovative project for fully motivated faculty and students that will apply knowledge and hands-on activities under a structured manufacturing-like environment that simulates what a company's manufacturing operation does. It relies on industry commitment for advice and faculty training and to perform audits for the simulated environment.  Creation of industry-recognized badges is planned as is incorporation of this credential into students' resumes.			","Students obtain work-based  learning while they prepare materials to be used in high school and college biotech programs.    Students are producing biotechnology materials/reagents for instructional kits.    They will be manufactured using cGMP processes and following standard quality control.   These kits will be provided to high schools and community colleges that teach biotechnology and biology in the Bay Area region.  The project follows industry processes for manufacturing and quality control while students practice soft skills required in the workplace.  In a nutshell, students work on real projects, like real scientists, on real equipment.","This project helps develop a career path for our high school and community college students.
Companies prefer students with work-based experience.   College biotech programs cannot procure industry internships for everyone in the class.   This project would help provide real, hands-on work -based experience for all students in a class.  This will help students applying for entry-level positions gain employment.   Employers prefer graduates with work based experience and we feel that this project will provide it by letting students experience different functions of a company (wear different hats) such as calibration, marketing manufacturing, quality control, and others and promoting entrepreneurial thinking.
","The project addresses: Hand-on manufacturing experience following industry-vetted process (manufacturing and quality control standards).   Provides opportunity to practice soft skills (customer service, teamwork, interpersonal and business communication, critical thinking, and work place discipline).  Colleges will be providing about 50 students that will be entering the workforce.   These individuals would have had work-based experience through the project at their college and will be equipped to competitively interview with companies and demonstrate the required soft skills listed in addition to cGLP, cGMP, regulations, and technical lab skills.    ","Per the labor market study presented in the 2016-17 Regional Priority Occupations profile for the sector, a gap exists, comparing awards to openings.    The gap market analysis shows that we have 4 fold openings for our students.   The project will allow work on improving the quality of the programs to train the worker that the industry requires.  On the other hand, we have found problems with internships.  There are just not enough internships for all students  and sometimes, when we have them some students do not have a car and cannot participate in internships due to company location/transportation problems.  In addition, internships are difficult to procure.   This project presents a new way to collaborate with an organization (BABEC) that has connection to HS teachers and CC instructors in the entire region that will distribute the products.  The proposal rationale complements all parts in  addressing the industry need for graduates but also the quality of the graduates through real-world experience."

"Continued growth in healthcare, along with the promise of high-wage and high-skill jobs, is leading to increased opportunities in the field of Allied Health and, in fact, to increased needs in the healthcare educational arena. Through a collaborative approach among Orange County’s Community Colleges, the K-12 system, and other regional stakeholders (from employers to workforce and economic development agencies to labor to governmental agencies) , the Health Workforce Initiative, and the growing healthcare industry, this Vertical Sector Leader Initiative is uniquely positioned to meet the evolving and unmet needs for healthcare training in the region. A collaborative approach and program alignment—with the VSL at the forefront—will result in the refining and expansion of training programs offering the potential for long-term employability and career growth. This project is expected to enhance existing programs where indicated, lead to new and innovative programs created in collaboration with and responsive to community partners and employers evolving labor market and healthcare training needs.
","The goal of creating a Vertical Sector Lead for Health is to expand the ability of Orange County’s colleges coordinate efforts, align initiatives and create build a range of opportunities across and between programs and colleges in the complex and critical healthcare labor market. The VSL will enhance and not replace horizontal efforts such as those lead by Doing What Matters Key Talent but will provide complementary approaches and insights around a critical sector identified by all of Orange County’s workforce and economic organizations. The role of the Vertical Sector Lead is to develop a regionalized support network comprised of participating colleges, DSNs, K-12 and industry partners, and other stakeholders working together toward the following goals: assess college and workforce needs as reflected by program outcomes and occupational/economic projections within the sector; enhance and expand partnerships and interface among regional stakeholders including business and industry, economic and workforce development boards, adult education programs, and four-year universities; develop curriculum, work-based learning opportunities and program alignments, and enhance structural supports for the colleges with programs in the sector to improve outcomes as reflected by SWP metrics.","The Healthcare sector is one of Orange County's three critical sectors and is the one with the highest projected growth in employment, wages and long-term employability. However, the job openings greatly exceeds the supply of community college graduates especially in those evolving allied health occupations. There is a continuing need in Orange County (as it is across the state) for higher wage and higher skills jobs such as nursing; in Orange County, however labor market needs expand significantly into middle skilled healthcare occupations (one of the primary focuses of the VSL's efforts). In addition, the boundaries of healthcare occupations are blurring and rapidly transforming due to technological change,  economic instability and industry -- and client/patient-- expectations and trends. The labor market for healthcare in Orange County is becoming more complex than less; in addition as stakeholders begin to collaborate new opportunities are identified and  the demands on the workforce -- for both short- and long-term education -- will increase at an accelerated rate.

"These funds will be used to reinstate the LVN program, reorganize the Medical Assisting and Certified Nursing Assistant programs, and create Phlebotomy, Home Health, and Dental Assisting programs at Lassen College.
Using Sierra College’s Restructuring for Success (R4S) model, the nursing program will be restructured into an Allied Health Program, which includes nursing. As an Allied Health Program, additional certificates, AA and AST degrees will be available to students interested in the Healthcare Practitioner and Healthcare Support occupations.
In addition, these funds will be used to expand the HESI program which is a three week summer job shadow opportunity for high school students to be exposed to healthcare careers.  ","There is a significant need for allied health care providers in Lassen County. Many healthcare professionals are forced to train their own employees, taking away from their treatment times and efficiency. The local hospital and prisons are also in great need of allied healthcare providers. 
This program meets the needs of Sierra College students and health care employers in the region who are looking for trained employees in hard to fill positions due to the rapid expansion of health care employment. Historically, Sierra College’s only program in the heath field has been nursing. Typically, 4,000 students declare a nursing major each year. The nursing major has capacity for 40 very competitive students. Thus, annually there are approximately 3,960 students at Sierra interested in working in the health care field and only 1% of these students get into the nursing program. Given the availability of health care professions beyond nursing that pay a livable wage and the demand for these positions regionally, there needs to be an increased in certifications and programs to prepare students for the range of jobs in the health care field.","This proposal will provide well-educated and trained employees for the needed allied healthcare positions throughout the county.","This proposal will produce more Licensed Vocational Nurses, Medical Assistants, Phlebotomists, Certified Nurse Assistants, and Dental Assistants.
This proposal represents a significant restructuring of how health courses are offered, how students are counseling about employment opportunities and health occupations, and a significant expansion in the health certificates and AAs to be offered at Sierra College. This new program is aligned with the college’s systematic restructuring program, Restructuring for Success (R4S) which is designed to increase the percentage of students completing a degree or certificate while decreasing the time and cost to do this. Allied health professionals include nurses, health care administrators, certified medical assistants, medical/phlebotomy laboratory technicians, emergency medical technicians/ paramedics, dental hygienists, diagnostic medical sonographers, dietitians, medical technologists, occupational therapists, physical therapists, radiographers, respiratory therapists, speech language pathologists and many more. Sierra College will increase the Allied Health Programs offered over time.  Allied health professionals comprise nearly 60% of the healthcare workforce.
Research conducted by the Restructuring for Success (R4S) Work Group in its Findings and Recommendations Executive Summary identifies that the annual demand, openings and wages for Allied Health positions in the Greater Sacramento region (El Dorado, Nevada, Placer, Sacramento, Sutter, Yolo and Yuba Counties) are as follows:
Health Services Cluster in the Sacramento capitol region is expected to grow from 160,000 jobs in 2016 to 243,000 jobs in 2019.
The Health Services Cluster provides the best earnings in the Sacramento capitol region with the highest annual wage in life sciences at $142,516 annually and the lowest in social assistance at $20,547 annually.
Medical and Health Services Managers have the highest hourly median wage at $58 an hour, and registered nursing were the second highest at $52 an hour
The economic impact for the healthcare service cluster is about $32.0 billion in output, almost 243,000 jobs and $14.4 billion in labor income.
There are 4,400 healthcare establishments in the greater Sacramento Region.
","Due to the shortage of allied healthcare providers in the region this proposal will help fill the positions and it will provide wage earning jobs for the students. 
One of the NFN regional competitive programs addresses how to increase capacity for training more nurses by expanding on-site training options. All economic development reports for the greater Sacramento Region identify the demand and opportunities for health care workers. The Capitol Region Industry Clusters of Opportunity, 2010-2015 report identified the industry clusters with the greatest opportunities for new jobs, rising wages, business expansion and career development opportunities and then listed the sectors in order of size and total number of jobs. The healthcare and social assistance cluster was at the top of the list. Within this cluster, the largest and fastest growing employment is in direct health services. Similarly, the Centers of Excellence’s Next Economy Cluster Research Workforce Needs Assessment for the Sacramento Capital Region, August 2016, identified Life Sciences and Health Services as the largest clusters in the region; offering well-paying jobs for thousands of people. This report identifies that the occupations with the greatest demand within the cluster are registered nurses, EMTs/paramedics and health information technicians."
"Development of a simulation users network group with a primary focus on development of simulations that can be shared with participating colleges and within the region.  The group will meet monthly to share best practices and strategies for student success. ","The Health Simulation Proposal addresses several needs of the Central Valley Bakersfield College, and our regional partners, are all located in the Central Valley/Mother Lode Region of California. It has been well documented the need of qualified healthcare workers in this highly underserved area. In fact, Registered Nurses (RN), Licensed Vocational Nurses (LVN), Emergency Medical Technicians (EMT), and Paramedics have been consistently identified in the top 100 occupations based on projected needs, with RN’s identified with the highest annual openings. (Economic Modeling Specialist International Sept 2016).
According to the United States Census Bureau report (2015), Bakersfield’s population has increased by 40.6% between 2000 and 2010.  This, coupled with the health and long term care needs of our aging population, including increased medical emergencies; growing numbers of people accessing the healthcare system due to the recent reforms in healthcare; the anticipated acceleration of retirements of healthcare workers, and the subsequent job vacancy forecast, all lead to a dismal projection in providing qualified trained healthcare professionals. (https://www.labormarketinfo.edd.ca.gov (2017).
Despite the increased enrollment numbers in the RN, LVN, EMT, and Paramedic Programs over the last 4 years, local hospitals report growing vacancy rates up to 12 – 18% with an upsurge in turnover rates. In addition, long term agencies, correctional institutions and outpatient facilities are reporting even higher vacancy and turnover rates. (Bakersfield College Joint Advisory Committee Minutes, January 2017). 
The increased enrollment numbers has created clinical placement site issues. Clinical sites are severely impacted creating limited space. This proposal, and its subsequent benefits, will decrease the impacted space at each clinical site, allowing students to participate in simulation based training in lieu of physically being present at the clinical sites, and will promote standardized clinical educational experiences of the Allied Health Division (faculty and students). 
In our central region we have a severe deficit of nurses, particularly in the specialty areas (Emergency Department, Critical Care Units, Perioperative Care, Ambulatory Care, and Labor and Delivery). This proposal will aid in both training faculty in Simulation education, integrate into curriculum, and provide consistent simulated educational experiences for the students. This will be necessary for the outlying areas where there are limited opportunities to care for higher acuity patients. 
In 2002, The Joint Commission (TJC) established National Patient Safety Goals as a method to reduce errors in healthcare settings.  Examples of patient safety measures include use of EHR and bar code scanning of medications. Some clinical sites are reluctant to give access to the EHR and automated medication dispensing units, and therefore students may have limited opportunities to use these safety tools. Simulation provides practice of these skills in a safe, controlled environment allowing learning experiences which will promote a smooth transition into the workforce.  
","Across the nation, the need for healthcare workers including Registered Nurses (RN), Licensed Vocational Nurses (LVN), and Emergency Medical Technicians (EMT)/Paramedics is increasing.  According to the U.S. Department of Labor (2012), unemployment decreased by two percent between the years 2000 to 2010. However, healthcare employment openings increased by more than 25% during the same period. The U.S. Department of Labor also projects than by 2020 nearly 1 in 9 jobs in the United States will be in the health care sector.
California mirrors this same trend with increases in the healthcare sector needed to fill new positions and replace current workers who will leave their jobs (e.g. retirement, attrition from the profession. etc.) over the same period. (U.S. Department of Labor., Health Care Employment Projections for 2010 – 2010, 2013).  California has been projected in an employment outlook report published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (2013) to need an annual average of   9,980 RNs; 3,170 LVNs; and 990 EMTs/Paramedics from 2014 – 2024.
In Kern County and the Bakersfield area, the projected need for these health care workers also shows increases in these jobs to meet the needs.  The California Community Colleges: Doing What Matters For Jobs and the Economy website has compiled the labor market data on five-year trends and projected job openings from 2014 to 2019 (www.cccco.edu,Launchboard, 2017). Registered nurses in our community have experienced a 5-year change of 1,654 new jobs with further increases for the next five years. Licensed vocational nurses have an increase in job openings from 2009 – 2014 of 1, 098. The next five years is also showing a projected increase in this occupation. Finally, the EMTs/Paramedics had an increase of 299 jobs from 2009 to 2014. The five-year trend is also growth for these healthcare support positions.
The needs of our regional labor market mirrors the trend in California and the nation for increasing numbers of healthcare workers who serve in technical and support positions.  These are programs that are supported by the community colleges through the associate degree or vocational certificates. 
Our aging population and the projected population growth in our region will continue to demand a large, strong, and qualified workforce to meet this need. Simulation in our healthcare education programs can make a difference in attaining this goal.
","This HealthCare Simulation Proposal addresses the need for more training hours, limited patient encounters and impacted clinical sites, regulatory oversight, and the problem of patient safety by using innovative training in a controlled environment with deliberate practice and assessment. This provides standardized educational experiences incorporating cognitive, psychomotor, and affective skills.  Furthermore, simulation based learning significantly improves skills and skill retention for participants. (Medical Teacher 10/06/2013, Vol 35 e1511 - e1530)
At a recent Joint Advisory meeting (January 2017) with our community partners, it was discussed that lack of access to the Electronic Healthcare Record (EHR), glucose monitoring, medication dispensing system and barcode medication scanning  are huge limitations to the student’s growth and development as effective practitioners. These limitations grossly restrict valuable clinical experiences, and inhibit their transition into practice. Additionally, there were concerns expressed these identified limitations pose a huge safety risk by not allowing the students to grasp the full picture to develop appropriate plans of care.

Clinical sites are over-burdened with the number of students, lack of resources, and qualified personnel to train students. Simulation will ease the burden on the staff and resources, and still provide high quality learning experiences. This is accomplished by providing standardized learning experiences in a controlled environment which may be customized to student’s specific learning needs and program curriculum. More specifically, simulated educational experiences may be tailored to meet the training needs of the higher acuity patients not consistently seen in the rural settings. Also, the need to focus on training for the specialty areas can be captured through the use of simulation. 
Other areas which this proposal, and its subsequent benefits addresses is faculty development in using simulation to enhance instruction, improve student retention, and skill acquisition; foster interprofessional cooperation between regional and local faculty, staff, and Allied Health students; enhance community relations, and; improve employability and increase employer satisfaction and enhancing the quality of the future workforce.
 “Fresno, Modesto, and Bakersfield-Delano areas are among the top five U.S. regions with the highest percentage of residents living below the poverty line.” (Associated Press, September 20, 2012). By increasing enrollment of students within in our programs, there will an increased number of students entering the workforce with certificates and degrees and the ability to obtaining a living wage.
","The proposal addresses the priorities established by our region, including: 
1)	Developing a Simulation Users Network group focusing on regional collaboration and  
        innovative practices. 
2)	Promoting best practices when using simulated learning experiences. 
3)	Developing standardize tools and resources that can shared among the network users. 
4)	Increasing student enrollment in the Allied Health Division.
5)	Enriching the lives of individuals and families by increasing the number of certificates and  
        degrees awarded to provide a living wage in a region with extremely high poverty rates. 
6)	Decreasing the burden on clinical sites while ensuing equivalent learning experiences 
        though simulation. 
7)	Aiding students to safely transition into the workforce, meeting the community standards 
        for entry level practice. 
8)	Decreasing attrition rates.

"The proposal is to redesign the Computer Information Systems program to align the coursework and certificates with new and more targeted employment opportunities to meet the regional needs in Cyber Security, Big Data and Business Analytics. The program will redesign courses and provide more non-credit computer application classes. The computer science program at Lake Tahoe Community College has seen declining enrollments and a lack of robust vitality.  This is at odds with a documented regional need for people to fill jobs in the industry and a growing interest in computer science topics and inclusion in the K-12 curriculum for children as young as four years of age.  We have the opportunity to revitalize the LTCC Computer Science through utilization of available Strong Workforce Program (SWP) Career & Technical Education (CTE) funding, curricula updates and alignment, introduction of new programs that align with industry demand, collaboration with tech companies for experiential learning opportunities, partnering with K-12 schools including dual enrollment, improving the online student experience, developing extracurricular exposure and immersion opportunities, and creating innovative hybrid programs focusing on entrepreneurship, making, and global experience.","Technology is being recognized as one of the major fields where there will be a shortfall in employees prepared to fill high demand, high pay jobs of the next decade. With this information in mind it is the best possible time for CIS to position Sierra College to meet the regional needs in areas such as Cyber Security and Big Data / Business Analytics. 
Put Strong Workforce Program (SWP) state CTE funding to work to modernize the computer science program to consistently attract and retain students, and assist in filling high-demand, high-wage jobs in the North Far North Regional Consortium priority sector of Information Computer Technologies (ICT). ","Workforce needs in Information Technology are rapidly changing. What employers need to support today’s business environment is much different than what was needed even a few years ago. This proposal will redesign and reorient the existing Computer Information Systems program into a program that is more aligned with high skill/high wage jobs in cyber security, big data and business analytics.","This proposal addresses the need by working with a reformed advisory council to restructure the existing CIS program by creating certificates that prepare students to meet the new and better paying jobs in cybersecurity (now needed by most businesses), big data and business analytics (needed by many businesses to remain competitive). Existing courses that focus on learning computer application and college readiness skills will increasingly be offered as non-credit classes. This proposal addresses emerging regional needs based on real-time data on employment demand generated through burning Glass.  Utilize a portion of the the SWP regional collaborative funds ($181k) to address workforce development needs in the in-demand, high-wage fields of cyber security through the development of Computer Science program infrastructure that will promote student enrollment and retention, meeting the preliminary regional SWP workforce development goal of a 5% increase in CTE program enrollment by 2018.  ","improving the partnerships with the region’s business community, along with more research using tools like Burning Glass will help the CIS Dept.to identify the best solutions for moving students into jobs that pay well and will have demand. Strengthening course offerings and degree pathways will help to improve completions as students have a clear focus on how to get where they want to be. This improved curriculum will strengthen partnerships with the business community as they see the “value add” for current and future employees.
The two main areas of focus identified are Cyber Security and Big Data/Business Analytics. Though we already offer some courses that align with these areas, this redesign will identify achievable outcomes suited to two-year curriculum and revise/develop the curriculum to meet the rising needs for a skilled workforce to support these newly emerging employment skills.
o	Cyber Security will include areas like Intrusion Detection, Monitoring and Response 
o	 Big Data / Business Analytics may include NoSQL, Data Warehousing, BI, CRMs, Supply Chain Management, and Transportation Logistics

"The Regional Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning, and Refrigeration Regional Collaborative (HVAC&RC) will enhance existing HVAC&R Programs at several participating Colleges in the San Francisco Bay region.  This initial regional collaboration includes faculty and staff at Laney College, San Jose City College, and Gavilan College.  Faculty at Santa Rosa Junior College, and Los Medanos College, San Francisco City College, and De Anza College may play a role in the regional collaborative efforts in order to prepare for future assimilation into the regional joint venture for HVAC/R.   ","The energy efficiency industry is experiencing extraordinary growth globally, nationally and regionally. Increasingly volatile energy prices, energy supply concerns, technology advances, climate change, regulations and mandates, and a desire for greater energy independence are all powering demand for additional energy efficiency efforts, and these pressures are likely to result in sustained long-term growth in the energy efficiency industry and related employment opportunities. 

In the spring of 2015, Doing What Matters and the University of California at Davis (UC Davis), with assistance from the Research and Planning Group for California Community Colleges (RP Group), undertook a research project to propose methods to attract more students to California Community Colleges’ Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning and Refrigeration (HVACR) certificate programs. The impetus for the HVACR project came from the recognition that the trades in general, but the HVACR industry in particular, face serious shortfalls in developing a skilled, trained, and available labor pool over the next 20-30 years. According to the Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute (AHRI), an estimated additional 57,000 skilled workers are needed each year to work in the HVACR industry.

In order to achieve these goals, it is absolutely necessary that the individuals planning to or who are currently working in the HVACR industry across the state are well trained and up-to-date on the technologies for which they are responsible. 

According to the CEC's ""Strategic Plan to Reduce “The Energy Impact of Air Conditioners"" (AKA:  ""HVAC Convener Report""), California should:  ""Develop and/or sponsor quality installation and maintenance training for contractors, technicians, and sales agents to increase the fraction of the estimated 40,000 installers, service and maintenance technicians trained and certified from an estimated 10 percent now to 100 percent by 2020

The quality of an educational program is dependent largely upon the abilities of the faculty within that program, resources available to them as instructors, and the learning environment conducive to instruction of a successful HVAC/R program.  This is particularly true for technical and emerging programs, which cannot develop, grow, or survive without adept faculty champions.  This proposal addresses a need to develop an HVAC/R programs at Gavilan College to help service the Bay Region and strengthening collaborative efforts with colleges with strongly developed HVAC/R programs.","This regional joint venture will engage the faculty at Laney College and San Jose City College to determine what they need to best support their programs and then be able to utilize that information in the growth of new and underdeveloped programs.  We will engage our current faculty & industry partners to help identify and recruit new faculty to teach in the community colleges.

We will enroll faculty into professional development that has been recommended by our industry partners to best inform curriculum. We will enroll more students into programs with stable, well prepared and supported faculty. 

We will employ faculty that can support HVAC programs in the region, not just at one particular campus. We will employ successful graduates from HVAC programs in the region as a result of having excellent faculty with strong industry connections.
","One recent national study estimates the number of employees in the industry could double, and perhaps quadruple, by 2025. Employers are already experiencing difficulties finding employees with specific training necessary for energy efficiency occupations. a well-trained workforce is important in designing and operating commercial and institutional buildings, which have increasingly sophisticated controls.

In California, as is the case elsewhere in the country, community colleges are well positioned to play a major role in training qualified workers for the numerous careers within the HVACR industry and to help address the identified labor shortage.  Successful HVAR/R programs require experienced faculty champions.   Faculty champions that can see to the sustainability of a program are sometimes difficult to find or to retain at our community colleges for a variety of reasons.  Some are full-time faculty with responsibilities and job requirements that do not allow them time to focus upon emerging programs.  Some are adjunct faculty that 1) are subject to last minute course cancellations and other issues of job instability, 2) teach at multiple campuses with little incentive to grow any one particular program, or 3) also work in industry and do not necessarily have a strong vested interest in the long-term viability of the college program. 

To strengthen our emerging technical programs, there needs to be a cohesive regional effort to recruit, develop, and retain talented faculty for both part-time and full-time positions.  Our faculty are the only ones that know exactly what equipment, what curriculum, what capital are needed to build or grow a sustainable academic program.  Only with a strong network of faculty champions will our campuses be able to develop the necessary human capital supply chain and meet the workforce needs of our region. 

 ","The growth of HVAC/R within the bay region is a priority.  Focusing as a start on programs in HVAC/R, this shift to a focus on faculty will indirectly be a focus upon increased enrollment in programs, and curriculum development for those programs that align with industry valued KSAs. 

A Regional Effort:

A focus on faculty must be a regional effort for HVAC/R, and likely for many other disciplines as well. By acting regionally, colleges can coordinate schedules to encourage “sharing” good instructors, can coordinate recruitment efforts for both faculty and students, and combine training/professional development programs.  Full-time faculty can serve as anchor faculty & mentors, helping to guide regional efforts, without over straining their schedules.

"This would augment the other regional and local funds for marketing.  Specifically, it would be spent on printing, advertising, staff to create and revamp marketing and advertising materials and websites for local programs specific to each college.  ","The proposal addresses the critical need to have up-to-date, attractive, recognizable, and tailored marketing for each CTE program at a college.  So many CTE programs are unknown or misunderstood and do not have existing marketing materials (paper or electronic) tailored to different markets (students, parents, counselors, industry partners, etc.).","This proposal will support each individual CTE program of the partner colleges, which helps bring students into the program and thus fill the labor market needs.

","Brand building provides an opportunity to move from laundry-listing of classes, programs, and benefits to distilling a unique promise that has the greatest value for our targets--students, employers, and community organizations.  Branding defines and disseminates a value system of qualities and character that make our district/colleges distinctive in our communities and region.  Branding and marketing must be specific and distinctive and will provide the mechanism to set our region apart from competing product from both public and private options.  This project will allow the colleges to find the place to occupy among what's important to their targets and make it theirs--programmatically, in customer service, in their inventiveness and in how they message it all.  This approach only works if it is kept time after time which is at the heart of this project.  

One of the most important unified objectives is to take a leadership position in CTE.  If a strong distinction can be made about how CTE is delivered the SCCCD way in context of a brand message, and individual colleges properly leverage that brand in CTE programming and in allied marketing executions, both District and individual colleges will be  more successful in meeting their objectives. 

In the process, colleges can still maintain their individuality with brand and communications standards.  Cost and communications efficiencies are a result, and targets find value in knowing their choices are credible and how these choices are organized and available. 
","Prospective students and employers are largely unaware of the CTE programs offered by our colleges and, thus, student are unable to access much-needed training to become employable and employers have difficulty finding skilled employees.  These are missed opportunities in an area that has high unemployment rates.  Employers and community organizations express a critical and urgent need for skilled employees and clearly indicate an extreme need to connect with college programs rather than turning to other means to secure employees.  This proposal will increase knowledge about career technical programs available at the SCCCD colleges and centers and will identify SCCCD college programs as the high-quality, robust, and effective programs they are.  Connecting students and employers to effective community college CTE programs is essential to the labor market. ","This proposal will result in enhanced involvement of all regional and local stakeholders – businesses and their representatives, workforce and economic development agencies, government, educational organizations, non-profits, and STUDENTS.  Connecting these stakeholders to the CTE programs and services at the colleges and centers will add to the potential for lasting impact. A truly effective campaign will also build on the longstanding efforts of others in the region, ensuring effective and efficient use of funds.  

A marketing campaign will benefit current and future students, increasing both enrollment and eventual employment for students and helping employers find the skilled employees they need. 

Alignment of this project with the broader branding and marketing efforts currently underway by the CCCCO is also important and will provide an opportunity to leverage the resources of both, leading to high efficiency and effectiveness.  
","The Central/Mother Lode Region strategic plan lists alignment as one of its four major goals.  Alignment refers to engaging with industry to align CTE programs with leading and emergent sectors; aligning services across multiple providers, and building partnerships of industry, labor, education, workforce and economic development entities; and aligning efforts to provide comprehensive regional career pathways that align with industry sectors.  This proposal provides the mechanism to help the colleges achieve this goal.  More importantly, it will also align students with programs, thus achieving the other three goals:  increase the amount of CTE instruction delivered, continuously improve CTE outcomes with a particular focus on cmpletion of industry valued credentials, job placement, and wage advancement, and close the equity gaps in program access, completion, and earnings of underserved populations.  This proposal will rebrand our CTE programs and provide an effective marketing approach to connect students to employers. "
"The Audiovisual Technologist Certificate Program will prepare students for the Certified Technology Specialist (CTS) certification exam administered by InfoComm International and entry-level jobs in the audiovisual industry.  Audiovisual technicians set up and operate audio and video equipment including microphones, sound speakers, video screens, projectors, video monitors, recording equipment, connecting wires and cables, sound and mixing boards, and related electronic equipment for concerts, sports events, meetings and conventions, presentations, and news conferences.  AV systems facilitate essential communications and often require connectivity with various types of networks, requiring AV technicians to work with IT teams to set up and maintain that connectivity. This aspect of audiovisual technology is evolving, influencing industry demand and the need for new curriculum.","There is no program in the region (or the state) to prepare students and skill-builders for the CTS certification and evolving audiovisual technologists careers.","In 2014, there were 2308 AV technician jobs in the SF Bay Area with a year-to-year projected growth of 7% through 2018 per the COE’s Demand and Supply data.  While this is modest job growth, the role is becoming more technical and 11% of CTS-certified AV techs in the Bay Area are retirement age, an industry concern.  The proposed project will implement a program to address the existing zero supply for this growing market demand.","This proposed project will develop missing courses based upon InfoComm International’s CTS certification prep curriculum, create the AV Technologist Certification program, and begin offering the new courses Spring 2018. 
","The AV technology industry is under the umbrella of the ICT/DM sector, one of the region’s priorities (second only to the health care sector).  Pathways to ICT careers have been a priority for CCPT (early college credit) and AEBG goals throughout the region and this proposal aligns with and supports those efforts."
"Support and develop pre-apprenticeship and apprenticeship coordinator position and office that will provide leadership of and coordination to apprenticeship providers and district colleges. ","With the increased need for jobs with sustainable wages and the increased emphasis throughout California on apprenticeship programs, there is a great need for colleges to communicate and work with local companies to develop training opportunities.  The complexity of the process to establish pre-apprenticeship and apprenticeship programs with both union led programs and non union programs requires a knowledgeable, single-point of contact approach, one that represents the entire district in communicating and developing training with one voice.","With high unemployment rates, high poverty rates,  and high rates of unskilled labor in the Central Valley,  it is critical to the economic development of the region to provide a mechanism for the unemployed to become qualified to apply to and be accepted in an apprenticeship program.  Establishing pre-apprenticeship programs, in partnership with community organizations, is critical in this process.  In concert with this effort, establishing and providing a way for employers to participate in apprenticeship training is also critical.  This proposal will provide the help needed by potential students in pre-apprenticeship training leading to apprenticeship training and also provide the help employers need to increase the skill levels of their incumbent workers.  Apprenticeship training results in better skilled workers, in long-term jobs, earning a sustainable wage. Apprenticeship has always been a part of the building trades’ success, but now more and more employers in sectors like manufacturing have realized it may be the answer to their workforce needs. In terms of workforce skills gap, apprenticeship may be the answer many sectors, including manufacturing, have been seeking.","An identified and knowledgeable coordinator can connect pre-apprenticeship and apprenticeship opportunities to college training programs.  At the same time, a coordinator can build partnerships with building trades and both union and non-union employers and provide students with the opportunity to secure sustainable wage jobs.  A knowledgeable coordinator who is connected to the community SCCCD serves can be the one voice that links employers to the colleges' programs.","A pre-apprenticeship/apprenticeship coordinator will establish partnerships with community-based organizations, district colleges, and adult education providers resulting in pre-apprenticeship training opportunities for unemployed, high-risk, high-need student populations.  Completion of pre-apprenticeship training provides the opportunity for students to become eligible for entry into a registered apprenticeship program and opens the door to high-wage, long-term jobs.  Additionally, establishing apprenticeship program partnerships enables employers to increase the skill level of their incumbent workers.  The complexity of these processes, procedures, and regulations requires a knowledgeable single-point of contact for employers, building trades, community-based organizations, and Single Employer programs  to be their required Local Educational Agency (LEA).  "
"SCCCD, on behalf of its three colleges and three centers, proposes to use SWP funds to establish a workforce/economic development function at the district level to coordinate college efforts and develop/enhance collaboration among the colleges and within the business/industry sectors.","Employers and community organizations continually ask for relevant, up-to-date information regarding CTE programs and services.  Efforts to increase CTE enrollments and completion must be well-coordinated and communicated throughout the service region in order to be effective.  This coordination and communication must include prospective students, employers, and community organizations.  Employers and community agencies have identified a need for more and better partnerships leading to an improved economic development environment.  Additionally, both employers and students have identified a need for coordination of programs and support services among the colleges and centers and transferability and/or portability of curriculum. "," The district dean of workforce and adult education will provide overall leadership in the coordination, planning, organization implementation, evaluation, and policy development for district-wide workforce programs.  A district dean will be a catalytic force to formulate, implement, collaborate, and promote career technical education and economic development throughout the State Center Community College District and regionally.    This position will serve as a liaison between the district and agencies administering district-wide workforce initiatives.  "," Working in tandem with staff and faculty across the district, the district dean will lead and coordinate efforts to ensure the effective delivery of relevant workforce preparation, economic development and training programs across the SCCCD service region. A district dean can serve in this capacity while coordinating district efforts with those of the colleges and centers. District-wide articulation of the career technical education programs among the district's colleges and centers will be increased and improved, as well as with secondary and other post-secondary institutions. A position at the district level will be able to establish and maintain working linkages and partnerships with industry, secondary education, and community agencies and organizations at the regional and state levels pertaining to the district-wide efforts in all sectors. ","The Central/Mother Lode Region strategic plan lists alignment as one of its four major goals.  Alignment refers to engaging with industry to align CTE programs with leading and emergent sectors; aligning services across multiple providers, and building partnerships of industry, labor, education, workforce and economic development entities; and aligning efforts to provide comprehensive regional career pathways that align with industry sectors.

"Allan Hancock College proposes to lead and support the development of a regional Culinary Arts/Hospitality collaborative to respond to sector workforce need as validated at each of three regional stakeholder meetings convened between August and October 2016.","Culinary Arts/Hospitality/Tourism in an industry sector that, in our South Central Coast Region, is currently without the support of a Deputy Sector Navigator. In the absence, therefore, of such a regional industry-focused key talent, this proposal, if successfully funded, supports and addresses Strong Workforce Taskforce Career Pathways Recommendations 3a-3e. Pending outcomes of the initiative, Recommendations 3f-h and other student support structures may be supported with additional resources.","According to the EDD, Labor Market Information Division, the Leisure and Hospitality industry sector, with a Location Quotient of 1.2, grew 18.1% between May 2012 and May 2016.

The goal of this project is to develop an Entrepreneurial Mindset Across Disciplines in CTE fields, as well as STEM, that have the potential to yield business ownership, partnerships, and corporate entities.  There is a gap in contextualized small business/entrepreneurship certificates and degrees and a lack of experiential learning by doing.  Students who desire business as a career and starting their own businesses need more opportunities for work-based learning.  
There is opportunity for each campus, across disciplines to:
•	Embed and infuse small business/entrepreneurship curriculum into their programs/courses
•	Create certificates and degrees with emphasis on small business/entrepreneurship
•	Have work based learning opportunities through small business/entrepreneurship
Students, faculty, and community members enrolling in entrepreneur and small business certificates and programs are the target of this project.  The driving force in this project is the promotion of self-empowerment, personal development, the value of team - all strengthened by one's role in planning and executing the entrepreneurial vision that meets the global needs of the twenty-first century.
This broad-based academic discipline approach will serve as a preparation for life and career. The challenges of the new century demand these new perspectives, regardless of whether the sector is private or nonprofit, in the general academic or in the skilled pre-professional.  
The Ice House Entrepreneurship Program will focus as a problem-based learning program designed to inspire and engage the region in the fundamental aspects of an entrepreneurial mindset. It will also serve as an outreach to a variety of enrollment targets and faculty in the classroom:
•Students – K-12
     -High School Business Academies
     -Dual Enrolled – 9th-12th grades
•College
     -CTE department students
     -STEM & Other Disciplines that promote business ownership
•Faculty
     -Across All Disciplines 
•Community
     -Introductory Workshops to promote campus programs/courses
Infused entrepreneurial mindset as an 
The design of this program is: 
•Assessment of Entrepreneurial Mindset Index (EMI) measures
•Strategies for Small Business/Entrepreneurship enrollment growth
•Three-part training and professional development series for Students, Faculty, and Community members
•Entrepreneur Summer Camp for high school and college students
•Training Institute development to help aspiring entrepreneurs to meet a tangible goal toward operating a successful business
•Community College to University pathway promotion
•Professional development activities such as the National Association for community College Entrepreneurship, Ice House Entrepreneurship Program/Facilitator Training, Online Entrepreneurship course for advancement education in the classroom and community
•Entrepreneurs events, workshops, summit, conferences for High School & College Youth, Counselors, Faculty, Administrators, and Industry professionals.","Examples of the need across disciplines is in career paths that lead to the nuts and bolts of operating a small business or becoming entrepreneurial:
•	HEALTHCARE: A Home Health Aide becomes an independent sole proprietor meeting the needs of patients
•	PSYCHOLOGY: a psychologist starts their own practice by opening up an office 
•	CHILD DEVELOPMENT: A Child Development Specialist starts a Day Care Center operation
•	AMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE: a graduate uses his/her foundational training to become a Private Investigator with a small business operation
•	CSIT: a student with stackable certificates in Support Services Technician starts his/her own business in troubleshooting computer issues for businesses
•	ENGINEERING: a graduate takes his/her interest in architecture to become an engineering consultant in a new downtown building project
","By the year 2020, more than 40% of the American Workforce, or 60 million people, will be freelancers, independent contractors or temp workers.

There are over 95,960 business establishments in Orange County, of which 99.8% (95,792) are small businesses (i.e., have <500 employees) that employ 1,043,489 people. Data from the U.S. Census Bureau indicates that businesses in priorities and emerging sectors account for approximately 39% of businesses in the region. The Priority & Emerging Sectors for CCCCO corresponds to US Census Sectors and report the following number of establishments per sector:
Health Sector - 10,507 
Retail/Hospitality/Tourism - 23,460
Advanced Manufacturing Sector - 4, 760
CTI - 1,470
Energy(Efficiency) & Utilities - 67
","A thriving sector has a multiplier effect in the economy that is an opportunity for small businesses, as emerging and priority industries grow so does their need for supplier and services. Thus, collaboration with key workforce and economic stakeholders, regional Workforce Investment Boards, economic development agencies, business organizations will be a strategy to take the pulse of small business growth areas to inform colleges which can link their CTE and small business programs accordingly and aspiring entrepreneurs and small business owners looking for good prospects for business development.  There’s also a gap in small business/entrepreneurship training in Orange County priority and emerging industries that include occupations that are often performed by independent contractors or small businesses/ entrepreneur: e.g., website, graphic designers, game developers, computer system analyst and technicians for small companies; auditors/data analyst. Designing modules in small business fundamentals that can be easily linked to colleges’ CTE and academic programs will be a strategy to address this gap.","Because Small Business and Entrepreneurship (SBE) is a cross-cutting sector it supports and represents establishments in most sectors including those considered a priority by the State Chancellor’s Office as well as within the Orange County Region.  By focusing this project on the dissemination of the Entrepreneurial Mindset for Student Success, students, faculty and programs across all disciplines can be supported."

"The Aircraft Fabrication & Assembly (AFAB) Technician Program is a collaborative project between Antelope Valley College, American Job Centers of California, the City of Palmdale, and aerospace industry partners.   The program will be located at the Palmdale Regional Airport facility at the Plant 42 site.  The program is offered in cohorts of 25 students--one daytime cohort and one evening.  The program is 320 hours of instruction over an eight week session.  College credit is earned and can be applied to degree and certificate programs at Antelope Valley College. In addition, the skill sets developed in this program have widespread application to all manufacturing sectors.
The AFAB facility at Antelope Valley College is currently not able to meet the increasing demands by local aerospace industries (specifically Northrop Grumman) for entry –level structural and composite technicians.  Northrop Grumman needs to employ at least 1000 AFAB students by December 2017, with a project 3000 to 5000 more in the next 3 to five years, and the current number lab facilities limits the program’s ability to meet these increased industry demands. In addition, other aerospace companies such as The Spaceship Company, Space X, and Lockheed Martin are also hiring students from the program. In order to meet the demands of local industry more AFAB labs need to be established. The Palmdale Regional Airport Terminal Building will be renovated as a secondary structures lab for the AFAB program and will be used to offer several of the AFAB courses.  In addition to the increased square footage,  a lab in the Palmdale area provides access to Palmdale residents and strengthens the partnership of the college and the communities in the area.  in addition, the program is geographically adjacent to major industry partners.
","The current AFAB lab is currently not able to meet the increasing demands by local aerospace industries (specifically Northrop Grumman) for entry –level structural and composite technicians.  Northrop Grumman in particular needs to employ at least 1000 AFAB students by December 2017, with a project 3000 to 5000 more in the next 3 to five years, and the current number lab facilities limits the program’s ability to meet these increased industry demands. In addition, other aerospace companies such as The Spaceship Company, Space X, and Lockheed Martin are also hiring students from the program. In order to meet the demands of local industry, more AFAB labs need to be established. ","According to data supplied by the Greater Antelope Valley Economic Alliance (http://kedc.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/GAVEA-2014-Round-Table-Report.pdf), aerospace industries in the Antelope Valley represents a large sector of the employed population in the area. Edwards Air Force Base employs 10,647 and China Lake Naval Weapons Base employs 9,172. The private sector employs over 8,000 people in jobs that support both the military and civilian areas of aircraft manufacturing. Among the major private employers in aircraft manufacturing in the Antelope Valley are Northrop Grumman Corporation (2,772 employees), Lockheed Martin Corporation (2,712 employees), and Mojave Air and Spaceport (2,500 employees among all employers). Mojave Air and Spaceport is the home of the first spaceport in the nation and base of Virgin Galactic and The Spaceship Company, private ventures engaged in making commercial space travel feasible. 

The data supplied by GAVEA is difficult to validate using the traditional methods of searching the California Economic Development Department website, the Bureau of Labor Statistics data, or data supplied by the Centers on Excellence. All three options were searched using the CIP Codes 49.0101 (Aeronautics/Aviation/Aerospace Science and Technology, General), 29.0401 (Aerospace Ground Equipment Technology), 49.0199 (Air Transportation, Other), 49.0104 (Aviation/Airway Management and Operations), the SOC Codes 17-3021 (Aerospace Engineering and Operations Technicians) and 11-3051 (Industrial Production Managers), and the NAICS Codes 336411 (Aircraft Manufacturing), 336413 (Other Aircraft Parts and Auxiliary Equipment Manufacturing),  336414 (Guided Missile and Space Vehicle Manufacturing), 336419 (Other Guided Missile and Space Parts and Auxiliary Equipment Manufacturing). None of the occupational descriptions associated with the CIP and SOC codes aligned with the interests expressed by the human resources and management representatives to the proposed program’s advisory group.  Depending on the source, employment opportunities in aerospace are either declining, holding steady, or slightly increasing in the Los Angeles-Glendale-Long Beach metropolitan area or in California. For example, for Industrial Production Managers, the EDD website shows that there could be 360 average annual openings in 2012-2022 in California with an hourly mean income of $52.44. There are 295 Aerospace Product and Manufacturing employers for this occupation in the state.  Demand for Aerospace Engineering and Operations Technicians is projected to be 450 employees between 2012-2022 in California (This occupation involves aircraft maintenance and repair, not aircraft production). Data supplied by the Centers of Excellence showed a projection of 940 jobs lost in the NAICS Codes that were explored. One manufacturer alone,  Northrop Grumman, needs to employ at least 1000 AFAB students by December 2017, with a project 3000 to 5000 more in the next 3 to five years.

","The renovation of the Palmdale Airport facilities will provide a local venue that is easily accessible for local residents needing to acquire the skills necessary for entry level employment in Airframe Manufacturing.  This project will both provide training and job opportunities for the local community but meet the needs of Northrup Grumman and other local manufacturing industry.","The Aircraft Fabrication & Assembly (AFAB) Technician Program meets goal #3 in the South Central Coast Regional Consortium Three Year Strategic Plan:  
Reinforce regional leadership and operational partnerships among community college, industry, labr, and other workforce and economic development entities to improve the delivery of all CTE efforts.  
The AFAB Technician Program  strengthens the leadership of Antelope Valley College in planning and meeting the industry CTE needs in the local community.  The partners involved have developed a concise plan to pool resources to effectively and efficiently meet the training needs for local residents who need additional skills in order to enter the growing local aerospace industry.  The project will also allow Antelope Valley College to relocate and reuse equipment as the industry needs change, allowing the college to continue to play a vital role in the community  economy.

The Retail/Hospitality/Tourism (RHT)  sector has continued to be identified by the  as a WIOA priority sector for high-demand jobs in Orange County in 2016-22, led by growth in the region’s economy and resulting upticks in the demand for workers in the sector.  The proposed project in the RHT sector also aligns with pathways and strategies identified by multiple regional adult education consortia in their three year plans (2015-2018); K-12 pathways and initiatives, like California Partnership Academies (CPAs), Linked Learning initiatives, and regional California Career Pathways Trust grants (CCPT); and regional workforce and education partnerships.

In addition the proposed VSL will meet the following Orange County Regional Priorities:

Develop better data to order to make decisions and measure outcomes at the regional level as a method of improving “Local Data Accountability”: through increased contact with employers and the collection and analysis of additional qualitative and quantitative data;

Improve Job and Career Readiness through opportunities for students for enhanced work-based learning, apprenticeships, internships for students, increased professional development and contract opportunities for faculty and the creation of a “Regional Job and Career Developer”;

Work to align and leverage resources between the regional community college system and other educational and workforce and economic development organizations such as the Workforce Development Boards, Chambers of Commerce, Orange County Business Council and others: this is a critical role with the position.

Create and implement more efficient career pathways from high school to college to career development: providing additional information and recommendations concerning this from all regional stakeholders;
 
Align “Vertical Sectors” in addition to “Horizontal” community college efforts with community college champions “Vertical Sector Leaders”;

Establish and shared protocols, methods and best practices for collaboration and cooperation within Orange County: this is a major outcome of this proposed effort.

"The goal of the Vertical Sector Leader: Global Trade & Logistics is to bring a global perspective to faculty, students, and programs vertically beginning in K-12 to Career.  Because GTL is considered one of the most cross-cutting sectors as it touches nearly all industries and job descriptions, a major focus is to build global awareness by creating an environment of exposure and infusion of global content across CTE pathways.  To accomplish this goal, the planned projects include development of GTL curriculum that can be used in CTE courses across campuses, adapting GTL curriculum to be used in High School classes and making these tools available on a Faculty Resource HUB, professional development opportunities available for faculty to attend conferences and industry externships, pathway development activities/events for high school and community college students and training and support for students and faculty to prepare for and pass industry recognized certification exams. A regional advisory of industry sector leaders, businesses and employers, education, workforce, and students will champion the cause and focus of this project. This project will rely on the support of Orange County DSNs for Global Trade as well as Small Business and Entrepreneurship who will provide critical connections to business and industry.  The OC colleges involved in this project will also work closely with the ProGTL LA/OC Consortia. This collaboration will provide the OC colleges access to the many activities planned by ProGTL including the Career Expo, CoffeeHouse Industry Series, IBEA Faculty Resource Hub, Regional Advisory Committees, etc. These efforts align with the following SWP recommendations:
1.	Broaden and enhance career exploration and planning, work-based learning opportunities, and other supports for students. 
2.	Improve CTE student progress and outcomes.
3.	Develop and broadly publicize industry-informed career pathways that prepare students for jobs needed within the regional labor market.
4.	Develop regional leadership and operational partnerships among community college, industry, labor, and other workforce and economic development entities to improve the delivery of all CTE efforts. 
5.	Develop robust connections between community colleges, business and industry representatives, labor and other regional workforce development partners to align college programs with regional and industry needs and provide support for CTE programs.","According to the Orange County Business Council’s (OCBC) Workforce Indicators Report “International Trade is a primary cross-cutting industry driver in Orange County due to its increasing presence across nearly all major traditional industry sectors. In fact, International Trade could be considered as Orange County’s “most” crosscutting sector in terms of its presence, and impact on, nearly every single other industry cluster.”
International trade accounts for 177,256 jobs in OC and continues to increase each year.  International Trade also provided the second highest average salaries in Orange County at $78,950. 
A recent scan of the major job boards and major employers supports the information presented regarding the need and priorities of the region. Positions for international marketing coordinators, compliance specialists/analysts and supply chain/logistics professionals are continuing to be advertised in industries such as Medical Devices and Pharmaceutical products. Defense, Telecommunications and Transportation.
The majority of employers surveyed reported challenges finding qualified employees with an understanding of the global marketplace. When employers in Los Angeles and Orange County were asked if they believed there was a lack of qualified workers entering the industry, 59% of them said yes.  Of that percentage, more than two-thirds of employers thought of it as a slight concern and more than a quarter of them believed it was a great concern.  
More than half of employers surveyed stated that there is a lack of qualified employees entering the GTL sector. This represents an opportunity for the community colleges to train more students for high-demand occupations in GTL.  Wages are appealing for entry-level workers, and show significant increases as workers gain more education and experience.","By providing training and exam support for industry credentials such as the NASBITE CGBP - certified global business professional and the CSCMP- certified supply chain management professional students will be qualified for employment in these key industries.  Students who have completed a community college certificate and/or degree along with the industry certifications can provide value to employers they day the start a new position.","All of the planned activities for this project focus on the fact that Global Trade is a Cross-Cutting industry driver.  With a focus of creating a global perspective across CTE programs and vertically from K-12 to Career, this project addresses the needs of a companies from a diverse industry pool who are looking qualified employees in areas across their company from marketing and accounting to shipping and production. By creating curriculum and pedagogy that can be infused across CTE curriculum and providing professional development support for faculty the global perspective can be infused into classes that are industry and career focused.  Preparing faculty and students to successfully complete industry certifications will make hiring of qualified employees much easier.  Finally by creating awareness of the global perspective at all levels of education for both faculty and students future growth of programs will be seen.","Global Trade and Logistics is considered a cross cutting industry by the OCBC which contributed to approximately 295,000 occupations to the county in 2015. Exports account for approximately 160,000 positions and with imports representing approx. the same number or 30% of all Orange County positions. California is the 6th largest economy in the world and Orange County is located just minutes south of the 2nd largest Port in the US (LA/Long Beach).  If Orange County were one of the 50 states, it would be the 17th largest state for exports of goods and services. International Trade represents the 2nd highest average salary in OC at $78,950.
The Center of Excellence in their most recent report on Global Trade for LA and OC Counties (Nov. 2014) listed the most in-demand occupations in the region.  They included:  
-Logistics Specialists/Coordinators 
-Regulatory/ Compliance Specialists 
-Global Sourcing or Procurement Specialists/Coordinators 
-Customer Service Representatives 
-International Sales Representatives/Associates 
-International Marketing Coordinators
Key findings obtained from this study indicated that new employment opportunities can be filled by community college graduates for these six occupations studied.

An online employer survey was conducted with more than 200 employers in the region about the six occupations selected for study.  This report presents findings from the survey about regional employers’ profiles, occupational data, job growth, wages, and job requirements. Skill gaps are also identified that community colleges could potentially address by offering new courses and/or adapting current programs to meet the current and projected needs of employers.

The following information about required skills and employer expectations was shared by our industry advisory committee:

Knowledge/ Skills needed for Global Trade 
- Written and Oral Communication 
- General knowledge of etiquette 
- Global geography 
- Microsoft Office Suite 
- Internships

"This project is to develop and implement a regional Signal Technician certification program for the Sonoma Marin Area Rail Transit (SMART).  Santa Rosa Jr. College in collaboration with College of Marin will develop and implement curriculum, training and certification of students for employment with the SMART organization.  This project could be shared across the Bay Area in that all rail systems have a need for opening in this specialized area of employment.  ","This proposal addresses an immediate need of the regional rail service between Sonoma and Marin counties.  This proposal can be disseminated across the entire bay area rail service providers in the future.  there is a current need for Signal Technicians and conductors for the rail service.  There is also a need for industrial technicians and diesel mechanics for their future employment needs.","The college partnership will develop education and training for the identified employment needs.

"Drones/Aviation and Engineering Technician (Robotics and Automation) project will create a collaboration aligned to meet the evolving workforce and educational needs in three interrelated arenas: engineering technology and robotics, automation and the emerging technologies  -- and associated occupational and educational opportunities-- of drones. This is a truly regional initiative which will bring together faculty, programs, colleges, employers, industry, government and non-profits to meet the skills needs of the workforce and make use of currently imperfectly aligned efforts and resources. The resulting programs and collaboratives will all enhance education and training in the design, building and use of drones: a multidisciplinary,  multi-partnered and innovative collective effort cutting across the SWP recommendations. ","Trends such as increased global competition (especially with Germany and Japan, who lead in this field), the ubiquity of the Internet of Things (IOT) and the explosion of applications all are impacted by – and impact themselves-- the emergence of new disciplines and occupations in automation and robotics – and their associated application to the design, manufacturing and use of drones.

The need in Orange County is this: build a system which brings together the programs, faculty and leaders from workforce development, economic development, business, industry and government -- among others-- to create a coherent educational effort centered on the confluence of automation, robotics and engineering technology all focused on the design, manufacturing and use of drones. The workforce needs are rapidly expanding as are the demands on educators and trainers to cooperate across colleges and disciplines; the employers' needs for employees with a range of inter-related skills and abilities that are adaptable to the multiple technologies associated with drones; and the need to meet the challenges for all in response to exponentially transforming occupations  associated with building and using of drones -- all these needs have resulted in this proposals.

","As the responses above demonstrate, the need for a workforce prepared through education on automation, robotics, engineering technology and their application to drones is becoming central to Orange County's economy. The Orange County Workforce Readiness Studies and regional reports all document the county's effort to attract and retain manufacturers -- especially advanced manufacturers-- by developing a workforce skilled in robotics, automation and engineering technology. The support of Deputy Sector Navigators from several sectors –Advanced Manufacturing and Utilities, Energy and Construction for example-- have all provided information, connections and recommendations on how to improve and expand offerings in robotics and automation and the long-term effects of drone technology on workforce and employer needs.   In addition, the Orange County Department of Education Pathways project has identified clearer pathways into careers in these fields and helped align K-12 and community college curricula. 

For example, Irvine Valley College and the University of California Davis Robotics Competition have helped introduce students to automation as part of several educational paths, occupations and careers. The National Science Foundation has provided funding for STEM program development through enhanced industry partnerships, non-profits, internships and work-based learning and sponsored events.

In addition, other stakeholders have also contributed resources and shared investments in education around automation – especially in the form of equipment. These include, for examples, Siemens, Fanuc and Johnson Controls.

One occupation in particular demonstrates the need for an up-skilled workforce in Orange County: Engineering (Automation and Robotics) Technicians. Automation engineering technicians use the principles and theories of science, engineering and mathematics to solve technical problems in research and development, manufacturing, inspection and maintenance. The work is typically a combination of technical, theoretical, and hands on skills to successfully measure, analyze, design, purchase, and construct automation systems for businesses. Engineering technicians may assist engineers and scientists, especially in research and development. They may also work in quality control departments, inspecting products and processes, conducting tests or collecting data. In manufacturing, they may assist in product design and development, process design or production. Others work with programmable logic controllers (PLCs), a growing field in the area of automation engineering technology that involves working with special-purpose computers to synchronize all of the technologies used for a manufacturing process. PLC professionals program set up and use these special-purpose computers. Automation engineering technology is applied to a wide variety of systems such as communications and process controls. Automation engineering technicians combine fundamental principles of mechanical engineering technology with knowledge of electrical and electronic circuits to design, develop, test and manufacture electrical and computer controlled mechanical systems, which are becoming the foundation of operation in industry. The automation industry is a branch of the electronics field and is one of the fastest growing areas of our national and international high-technology economy. It combines the fields of electronics, electrical, and mechanics and includes the interaction and control of motors, computers, pneumatics, hydraulics and other processes used in manufacturing. The Automation Engineering Technology program will serve the needs of the community by providing valuable career technical engineering focused on the needs of industry, in addition to providing highly articulated course credits which can be used to further students education in the field of engineering.

This is a representative instance of exactly the kind of new occupations and skills that will be needed in Orange County.","The Drones/Aviation and Engineering Technician (Robotics and Automation) Project will respond directly to the local and Orange County needs for new cohorts of students trained in emerging engineering technology fields and the occupations associated with the design, manufacturing and use of drones. There is a strong need for greater for skills, knowledge and abilities – and preparedness-- for workforce in this area.  Engineering technology is now, more than ever before, across multiple sectors such as advanced manufacturing and robotics. 

The purpose of this proposal is to focus engineering technician training especially around automation and robotics on a rapidly evolving and explosively expanding field: drones.

The project would answer some immediate and critical needs in Orange County. There are significant job openings in the region that involve automation-related skills and experience in general. Improved articulation of programs across colleges within the region would help both students and employers; industry would benefit from better identifying current employers who could be retrained and up- skilled for automation jobs.  

In addition, the project also directly responds to Orange County’s intent to become the “innovation county” for the US. The evolution of drones and their design, production and use have become hallmarks of technologically advanced – and growing --  ecosystems likely to succeed in the future. Aligning efforts around training in automation, robotics, engineering technology and drones is a true regional, cross-college, stakeholder-driven and innovative approach with the potential for unprecedented (and scalable) results and practices.

The Initiative would result in: increased enrollment in courses and programs and success in certificates and degrees; clearer pathways in from K-12 to community college (and potentially to four-year institutions) to employment for a rapidly growing asset of new occupations; improved and innovative curriculum; clearer definitions of what constitutes “automation” and how it is integrated across many disciplines; the potential for further concentrations and specializations in areas such as automatics and robotics; and bringing together partners and efforts which cut across sectors. 

A coordinated marketing plan with connected outreach would attract students to  a wide range programs while informing employers about options and opportunities in the workforce in several different fields simultaneously. In addition, training for incumbent workers could be part of this effort, tapping into the needs of a workforce and employers for already skilled employees returning to work.

In addition to the participating colleges and districts, the effort will become a convening organization for employers, business and industry leaders, workforce and economic development organizations, and universities among others: a point of convergence for organizations with aligned interests and shared investments in a merging set of fields and sectors.

"Project 4: The Get Focused/Stay Focused curriculum has been effectively tested in high schools by several community colleges in all 7 regions in the state for use with over 80,000 secondary level students. Who am I? What do I want? How do I get it? – These are three questions that are keys to student success, and three questions that should be answered before selecting a guided
pathway. Career Choices and Changes, and My10yearPlan help students answer these questions while facilitating a planning process that:
- Matches pathway selection to future student goals
- Results in informed decision making regarding a course of study
- Development of a skills-based education plan
- Leads to a 10-year Plan focused on successful completion and workforce entry
Whether as a part of the First-Year Experience or implemented preemptively in collaboration with secondary school partners, the 10-year Plan relieves overtaxed advising services while supporting
greater student success. This is a 3 unit curriculum that will ensure students become high school completers and help reduce attrition and increase college completers. 
","As noted in the Task Force on Workforce, Job Creation, and a Strong Economy recommendations, this proposal addresses the following needs:
• Career guidance, including awareness and exploration of the many occupations and associated skill requirements labor market demand, and earning potential that allow students to make informed choices about selecting a program of study. 
• Career pathway planning with academic and contextualized support services.
• Provide resources for student support and career
center services to raise the awareness of career
planning and provide information to high school,
adult education and community college students
on labor market demand and earnings potential. ","This curriculum allows students to explore high-demand, high-pay career areas, and to investigate local labor market information as part of the curriculum, in addition to exploring their ""dream"" jobs. Students are exposed to jobs in their region's priority sectors.","In the South Central Coast region, implementation has already taken place at the majority of high schools interested in adopting the curriculum. The challenge now is for students in 10th, 11th and 12th grade to revisit their 10 year plans and update them, ready for entering college. The proposal is therefore to provide seed funding for implementation of the follow-up modules, so that the students ""Stay Focused"" and enter the colleges with a declared major and an education plan, in alignment with the Student Success and Support Act requirements. Additionally in areas of the region where the follow-up modules have already been adopted, it is hoped that middle schools will begin implementation of the ""Building a Bridge to your Future"" curriculum that prepares students to take the Get Focused/Stay Focused curriculum in 9th grade.","The region has received large amounts of funding for the development of career pathways in the last 3 years, through the California Career Pathways Trust grants, SB1070 funding, and ongoing Perkins and Transitions funding, among other funding streams. This Get Focused, Stay Focused curriculum has been implemented across the region as a foundational class for students to engage them in thoughtful career exploration and planning in 9th grade before they move into career pathways classes as high school juniors and seniors."
"Allan Hancock College's Public Safety Training Complex (PSTC) serves as a premier training location for Fire, Law Enforcement, EMS, and Environmental Health and Safety. As a unique regional asset for workforce training, the PSTC serves students enrolled in the college's public safety programs and additionally provides specialized and customized training that meets the needs of local, regional, state, national, and international public agencies and private industries. 

This proposal, if successfully funded, will engage regional and statewide faculty members, administrators, and public agencies to foster development and implementation of training and workshops in response to industry need, such as CORE Custody Academy and OSHA train-the-trainer workshops; provide faculty stipends for curriculum development; support acquisition of related instructional supplies, equipment, and props; develop career pathway promotional awareness and marketing materials aligned with regional marketing and outreach efforts; and provide safety enhancements to the PSTC's Emergency Vehicle Operations Course (EVOC).","In the South Central Coast Region, there is documented unmet demand for jobs in the public safety sector. For example, there are 143 annual openings for police and sheriff's patrol officers and 56 annual openings for correctional officers and jailers. Allan Hancock College is the only community college in the region that offers basic law enforcement training that is certified by the California Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training.  

The 220-hour CORE Custody Academy, certified by the California Standards and Training for Corrections, was successfully piloted in fall 2016 and had been developed, in part, to meet the demand of correctional facilities being constructed in San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara.","Public Safety was identified as an unmet workforce need at each of three sub-regional consortium stakeholder meetings convened between August and October 2016.","This project, if funded, will meet the needs of the South Central Coast Region by improving and enhancing public sector programs of study through strategic investments in such areas as curriculum development, faculty professional development, instructional supplies, equipment, development of promotional and marketing materials, and in completing safety enhancements of the closed loop EVOC track.","The proposal addresses Regional Strategic Plan Goal #3 (Reinforce regional leadership and operational partnerships among community colleges, industry, labor, and other workforce entities to improve the delivery of all CTE efforts); Goal #4 (Align college programs with regional and industry needs and provide support for CTE programs); and Goal #5 (Create a sustained public outreach campaign for industry, high school students, counselors, parents, faculty, staff, and community at large to promote career development and attainment and the value of career technical education)."

"The project is Year One of a multi-year plan that will address the needs of the regional economy in this sector. The plan includes industry engagement, regional advisories, curriculum enrichment/enhancement, updated equipment, professional development, career awareness and pathway development, and new and incumbent worker training. According to the AEE-Advanced Energy Economy, nationwide an estimated additional 57,000 skilled workers are needed each year to work in the Energy Efficiency industry. California's Advanced Energy industry needs highly skilled workers­15,000 more of them every year. The Doing What Matters Energy Construction &Utilities sector team and regional ECU Deputy Sector Navigators are fostering opportunities for regional collaboration that unify initiatives to build a
fully qualified workforce to meet the region's and California's energy efficiency mandates, with the goal of unlocking economic growth through investment in energy efficiency education and skills building programs.
","Energy Construction and Utilities is an emerging industry sector with a significant gap in technically skilled workers. Small, medium, and large organizations in Orange County who provide the workforce for this sector are rapidly adopting robotics-based technologies to operate construction equipment, utility delivery, control, and management systems. According to the Orange County Workforce Indicators Report 2013-14, Energy related jobs are expected to increase by 16% over the next five years. By 2020, jobs are expected to increase from 78,000 to 80,000. Of these, 3000 (16%) will be openings and will provide opportunities for recent IVC and other regional graduates to pursue careers mentioned above. Median hourly earnings for these occupations in Orange County range from $22.15 to $66.56, with the overall median at $29.98, which exceeds the minimum wage requirement for Orange County. The key issues to address in the coming years is in supplying employers with a steady pipeline of apprentices and technicians qualified to fill gaps in employment county-wide. Specialized skills derived from the STEM disciplines are widely applicable to a large number of county businesses today and in the near future. ","According to the AEE-Advanced Energy Economy, nationwide an estimated additional 57, 000 skilled workers are needed each year to work in the Energy Efficiency industry. California's Advanced Energy industry needs highly skilled workers -15,000 more of them every year. In order  to best  meet the  needs of the  Energy, Construction and Utilities sector, community colleges, industry and economic development partners in Orange County need to work together to develop a regional workforce plan. The Doing What Matters Energy Construction & Utilities sector team and regional ECU Deputy Sector Navigators are fostering opportunities for collaboration that unify initiatives to build a fully qualified workforce to meet the region’s and California's energy efficiency mandates, with the goal of unlocking economic growth through investment in energy efficiency education and skills building programs. The description of this project is Year One of a multi-year plan that will address the needs of the regional economy in this sector. The plan includes industry engagement, regional advisories, curriculum enrichment/enhancement, updated equipment, professional development, career awareness and pathway development, and new and incumbent worker training. Evidence indicates that workforce quality has become a barrier to Energy Efficiency goals for the built environment set by AB 32 in 2006 SB 350, the Clean Energy and Pollution Reduction Act of 2015, calls  for a doubling of these  goals, potentially creating thousands of new jobs  but adding  further concern about workforce quality related to achieving the state's mandates. California needs a plan to meet the SB 350 workforce challenge. 
California employment totaled approximately 321,000 Energy Efficiency workers in 2015. Just under three-quarters of firms (73%) report difficulty finding qualified workers in 2015, two in 10 employers report that hiring was ""very difficult”. The top two reasons for difficulty were lack of experience, training. or technical skills (44%), and insufficient qualifications. certifications. or education (31%). Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning HVAC) is a good example of the workforce barrier. 40% of the Energy Efficiency workforce is employed in HVAC positions. The California Energy Commission estimates that up to 50% of new HVAC systems and up to 85% of replacement systems are not installed and maintained to a quality level of specification. Significant capacity shortages exist. The state's training institutions supply about half of the 2,000+ new HVAC workers needed annually.

","The Regional Community Colleges, The Doing  What  Matters Energy  Construction & Utilities sector team  and regional EC&U Deputy Sector Navigators are fostering opportunities for  regional collaboration that unify  initiatives to  build a fully-qualified workforce to meet the  region's and California's energy  efficiency mandates, with the  goal of unlocking economic growth through investment in regional energy efficiency education and skills building programs.. The plan includes industry engagement, regional advisories, curriculum enrichment/enhancement, updated equipment, professional development, career awareness and pathway development, and new and incumbent worker training. This will be accomplished by exploring the current curriculum within the existing programs of study, including Looking at course outlines, student and program Learning outcomes, skills assessment tools & processes, , and assessing the needs for faculty professional development. The goal of this process is to look regionally at the totality of what is offered and, to identify gaps in supply and skills. This will provide a clearer picture of what is needed (demand) and what is out there (supply). Industry will identify specific needs for new or updated equipment, enhanced curriculum, and faculty professional development, all of which will be addressed in Year One. They will also identify, the need for new programs of study (certificate and degree programs}, which will be vetted for inclusion in subsequent Strong Workforce Projects in Years Two and Three. The benefit of having the regional partners in this sector engaged in this process and working alongside educators  is that it will result in the development of a Regional Industry Advisory. This will serve the needs of colleges, which are required to have actively engaged industry advisories as part of their Perkins programs, and will serve the needs of industry, which can remain engaged with education partners without having to attend multiple single college advisory meetings. This includes expanding the use of industry-valued third party, evidence based, assessments and credentials. 
This initial List includes Advanced Lighting Professionals, Construction Inspection Technicians, Building Sciences, Energy Auditing, Analytics, and Facilities Management. In Year 1, the focus will be on planning, however some curriculum will be developed and faculty professional development provided in areas prioritized by industry or the college partners. Plans for Years 2 and 3 will be developed and vetted by all partners. Colleges will immediately access the Strong Workforce funds to purchase recommended upgrades and new equipment. Programs cannot be enriched or expanded to meet industry needs until they have state of the art equipment that meets industry standards. Colleges will also be able to purchase equipment they feel adds value to the related programs of study. Professional development – 
Faculty will need professional development and, in some cases, additional training to develop new course outlines and Lesson plans and learn to use and teach with the new equipment purchased. In some cases faculty will offered externships to further develop their skills. Faculty externships will likely be developed and funded in Year 2. Increased Career Awareness and Career Pathway Development- Strengthening the pipeline must include strengthening the partnerships with K-12 and adult education partners. The project will begin by having the colleges  identify the related high school career pathway programs (STEM/STEAM Pathways, environmental/sustainability, and anything related to construction), and well as traditional education partners who are not yet aligned into pathways. 
The project will focus on strategies to engage students in engaging and innovative career awareness activities related to the sector, including online career awareness tools, videos, campus visits with hands-on activities and classroom presentations. Industry will be engaged to provide career awareness and classroom discussions to increase enthusiasm for the related careers. The colleges will develop a regional approach, capitalizing on best practices. This will increase the number of students who enter into the pipeline. Work Experience and Internship - Having the opportunity to have hands-on experience in an industry setting is an important experience to increase the Skills and job readiness of students. Working closely with industry partners, workforce system and others, the Regional Workforce Plan will develop a repository for work experience and internships (paid and unpaid) in the region and a process to match qualified students. Electronic/online internship and placement systems will be evaluated (Launch Path, Viridis, and others) for implementation in subsequent years. Incumbent Worker Training -As a result of #1 above, industry will also have identified the need for current worker training and up-skilling. To meet that need, colleges will work with industry to develop non-credit training to meet the specific needs of the industry partners engaged in the process.


","The Energy Construction & Utilities Strong Workforce to Industry Standards proposal is designed to address a burgeoning need for new entry level and replacement workers and addressing the identified skills and competencies gaps of the incumbent workforce to complete work processes to industry expected competencies and standards. An example, is that COE LMI data indicates in a segment of the Energy Efficiency workforce sector in the greater southern California four counties (Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties) for the annual requirement for the HVAC-R industry for qualified entry level workers, the combined number of certified completers through community colleges, for-profit trade schools and registered apprenticeship programs can fill only about 50% of the demand. Other Regional targeted energy efficiency middle skills occupations include: Construction Inspectors; With over $15,000,000,000 (Billion) in Los Angeles and OC civil projects and infrastructure public investment, (LAX, Transit, Ram's Stadium, water works) there is a bourgeoning shortage of Construction related Safety & Health, Quality Assurance, Compliance, and certified inspectors and officers. Facilities Mangers; Bridge the regional short fall of ~3,200 and statewide Facility Manager supply/demand gap of ˜6,000 workers annually through tracks for entry-level education and incumbent worker training. Advanced Lighting and Building Control’s technicians; Provide curriculum, lab equipment, and faculty professional development to integrate latest manufacturers’ technology into electrical programs. Energy Auditors and Analytics technicians; Develop an additional career entry-point/pathway for students in energy consulting & analysis to meet CA statewide policy demands for auditing of commercial buildings. Building Science; Establish a sustainable relationship between Building Science-related community college programs of study with industry partners (government, employers, high schools) so a pipeline of incoming students can be educated, trained, and placed into jobs."
"Demand for Drone related skills are increasingly apparent in several disciplines.  These include Photography, GIS/Mapping, Agriculture, First Responder, and software development.  Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) licensing is also required of anyone flying a drone for non-hobby use.

This proposal will develop curriculum and training for instructors to become licensed commercial drone pilots. The instructors will take the knowledge, skill and abilities by to their campuses to educate train students to compete for jobs in the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV/Drone) industry.
  
Areas of focus will include flight operations, data analysis, flight programing, outfitting, repair and maintenance of Drones. The intent of this proposal is to have Instructors across all disciplines create courses in the discipline-specific uses of drones. 

The proposed activity is a joint effort between at least 10 colleges and workforce agencies in the SF Bay Area to develop curriculum and other instructional material to meet regional needs, while building on one-another's efforts and investments.  ","This proposal is to develop a regional collaboration across the entire bay area colleges to form a regional commercial drone training program, co-developing curriculum for pilot certification, and discipline specific programs.  Possible programs include Art/Photography/Film, Digital Media, Public Safety, Civil Engineering, Surveying/Mapping, Geospatial Sciences, Real Estate, Administration of Justice, Agriculture, Real Estate, and others.  
This effort will provide faculty training, software and hardware in support of Drone (Unmanned Aerial Systems-- UAS) related additions to existing curriculum and new curriculum development. 				","Does this project create NEW jobs?  Probably not.  This project will train mostly incumbent workers to use a new technology to enhance their present job.  The question is more along the lines of ""Did programs avoid teaching digital photography as it didn’t create more jobs than film photography provided?  Or do we teach hybrid maintenance to auto students only in response to new jobs? The answer is no.  But it was a necessary skill to keep current in the industry.   Sometime we incorporate new technologies just to stay current as everyone (or many) professionals need to know them.  ","Its not all about flying drones and capturing images or video.  Students need to understand best practices and regulations for flying drones, capturing sequential shots and stitching them together into a single picture or videography.  How all the basics of good photography (e.g., composition, lighting) are envisioned and captured through a drone camera while abiding by the rules and regulations of piloting this aircraft.","Instead of every college going in a different direction to get to the same point, we develop a regional approach so that all share in the knowledge, equipment, technology, abilities and skills to allow a student, regardless of their residence in the bay area, to be able to gain the knowledge skills and abilities to move forward in a job, create a new job or add skill to their resume."

The description of this project is Year One of a multi-year plan that will address the needs of the regional economy in this sector.  
The specifics of the plan includes industry engagement, regional advisories, curriculum enrichment/enhancement, updated equipment, professional development, career awareness and pathway development, and new and incumbent worker training. 
 Activities will include:  College program scan and development of a regional industry advisory; Enhanced and enriched curriculum and equipment: Professional development; Increased Career Awareness and Career Pathway Development;Incumbent Worker Training 
1. Industry engagement, college program scan and development of a regional industry advisory – Industry will be engaged in a process to evaluate how well the region’s education/training programs are aligned with industry needs. This involves not only looking at gaps between supply and demand, i.e. growth and replacement numbers compared to the pipeline (projected completers), but also looking at skills gaps and the need for up-skilling of the workforce.  This will be accomplished by exploring the current curriculum within the existing programs of study, including looking at course outlines, student and program learning outcomes, skills assessment tools & processes, existing tools & equipment, and assessing the needs for faculty professional development.  The goal of this process is to look regionally at the totality of what is offered and to identify gaps in supply and skills.  This will provide a clearer picture of what is needed (demand) and what is out there (supply).  Industry will identify specific needs for new or updated equipment, enhanced curriculum, and faculty professional development, all of which will be addressed in Year One.  They will also identify, the need for new programs of study (certificate and degree programs), which will be vetted for inclusion in subsequent Strong Workforce Projects in Years Two and Three. 
 
The added value of having the regional partners in this sector engaged in this process and working alongside educators, is that it will result in the development of a Regional Industry Advisory.  This will serve the needs of colleges, which are required to have actively engaged industry advisories as part of their Perkins programs, and will also serve the needs of industry, which can remain engaged with education partners without having to attend multiple single college advisory meetings.  
 
Enhanced and enriched curriculum and equipment – Based on the above analysis, the immediate and most critical needs for program enhancement and equipment upgrades will be addressed in Year One.  According to industry analysis and data, there are several areas of specific need for enriched program development and expanded industry certifications.  This might translate to the need for more colleges to offer the certificate and degree programs or for expanding the content of the curriculum and certificate programs that are currently offered.  This includes expanding the use of industry valued third party, evidence based, assessments and credentials.  This initial list includes Advanced Lighting Professionals, Construction Inspection Technicians, Building Sciences, Energy Auditing and Analytics and Facilities Management.  This list will very likely be expanded or perhaps changed, as we will have sustained industry engagement throughout the process.   Through a strategic approach which will consider geography, immediacy of the need and college capacity, additional colleges will enrich or develop courses and certificates.   In Year 1, the focus will be on planning, however some curriculum will be developed and faculty professional development provided in areas prioritized by industry or the college partners.  Plans for Years 2 and 3 will be developed and vetted by all partners.   
 
Colleges will immediately access the Strong Workforce funds to purchase recommended upgrades and new equipment.   Programs cannot be enriched or expanded to meet industry needs until they have state of the art equipment that meets industry standards. Colleges will also be able to purchase equipment they feel adds value to the related programs of study. 
 
Professional development - Faculty will need professional development and, in some cases, additional training to develop new course outlines and lesson plans and learn to use and teach with the new equipment purchased.  In some cases faculty will offered externships to further develop their skills.  Faculty externships will likely be developed and funded in Year 2 . 
 
Increased Career Awareness and Career Pathway Development – Strengthening the pipeline must include strengthening the partnerships with K-12 and adult education partners.  The project will begin by having the colleges identify the related high school career pathway programs (STEM/STEAM Pathways, environmental/sustainability, and anything related to construction), and well as traditional education partners who are not yet aligned into pathways.   Young people have been overly conditioned to think of the trades as a lesser calling compared to the more popular career paths – this must be addressed.  The project will focus on strategies to engage students in engaging and innovative career awareness activities related to the sector, including online career awareness tools, videos, campus visits with hands-on activities and classroom presentations.  Industry will be engaged to provide career awareness and classroom discussions to increase enthusiasm for the related careers. The colleges will develop a regional approach, capitalizing on best practices.  This will increase the number of students who enter into the pipeline.

Work Experience and Internship - Having the opportunity to have hands-on experience in an industry setting is an important experience to increase the skills and job readiness of students.  Working closely with industry partners, the Chamber, workforce system and others, the Regional Workforce Plan will develop a repository for work experience and internships (paid and unpaid) in the region and a process to match qualified students. Electronic/online internship and placement systems will be evaluated (LaunchPath, Viridis, and others) for implementation in subsequent years.   
   
Incumbent Worker Training – As a result of #1 above, industry will also have identified the need for current worker training and up-skilling.  To meet that need, colleges will work with industry to develop non-credit training to meet the specific needs of the industry partners engaged in the process.
","Los Angeles County Economic Development Corporation (LAEDC) 2016 published the second edition of the annual report, People, Industries and Jobs.  The report provides occupational forecasts and industry growth forecasts for the region. The report offers findings for both the City of Los Angeles and County of Los Angeles, and was sponsored by the Workforce Development Boards (WDBs) of both the County and City of Los Angeles. Findings of the report include:
Employment growth of 1.5 percent annually over the next five years is expected to add 346,100 jobs in Los Angeles County and 122,700 jobs in LA City, across a broad range of industry sectors.
Industry sectors with the highest projected growth rates (in percentage) are construction,The industry, which currently employs more than 313,000 workers across Southern California, is expected to generate 95,000 job openings during the next five years, including as many as 30,000 for skilled trade workers and  professional and business services, education and health care services, and leisure and hospitality.
Middle-skilled occupations (those requiring more than a high school credential but less than a bachelor’s degree) with the greatest hiring potential are in the sectors of; health, transportation, construction and energy 
According to a 2015 Los Angeles County Economic Development Corporation (LAEDC) Business Climate Survey, fifty-nine percent (59%) of C-level executives in L.A. County find it difficult to fill key positions. Since more than half of the businesses surveyed are planning on expanding their operations within the next 24 months, the difficulty of finding top talent is compounding as employers are increasingly struggling to find workers who possess the necessary skills to fill job openings. Unfortunately, this regional skill gap is projected to grow, not dissipate. The economic leadership of the region are forming sector-based partnerships between community and four-year colleges, as well as regional workforce system partners, such as Workforce Development Boards and labor union apprenticeship and labor management training programs, to train and place talent in key clusters. Finding specific to the Energy/Construction sector include: near term trends include increased urban densification, improved energy-efficiency of buildings, continued adoption of technological enhancements such as advanced building controls and building information modeling. ? The construction industry continues to improve efficiency and capability through advances in technology, modeling and innovative processes.

"Proposal to develop a business plan for a maker's space.  The plan will yield financials, an operational study, equipment/tool/facility needs, plans for community engagement, methods for integrating into curriculum, and opportunities to braid funding sources. 			","The needs this proposal addresses are opportunities for an inclusive environment where students, entrepreneurs, inventors, and hobbyist alike can build a community within an academic setting that is innovative, proactive, and most importantly mentally stimulating. By facilitating access to tools people of all ages can acquire a deep knowledge about the machines, materials, design process, and the engineering that goes into invention and innovation. Makers gain invaluable skill-sets that can be implemented directly into the workforce. This we believe to be the direst need in our communities and in our region. 
Industries of economy have historically coexisted between local entrepreneurship and global markets. Our vision is that by creating a platform where individuals have exposure to advanced manufacturing training, they will be empowered to make a difference in their communities and to the world by the expression of their natural talents, abilities and skills. By teaching new technology, and introducing hands on skilled trades, we can increase enrollment and promote employment opportunities by establishing relationships with industry and partners while the duration of the curriculum.  
Maker’s space inspires the next generation of entrepreneurs, engineers, and innovators. It is transforming current educational curriculum, business models, and global organizations by broadening opportunities to access global markets, global networks, and global education. ","In our region, advanced manufacturing is a priority economic sector with constant demand for labor. By having a localized space where students can learn different industrial high-tech equipment they are better suited to incorporate and adapt themselves in the fast pace workforce. The use of the space, as well as the exposure to the work of other users allows for an increased learning experience that is versatile and adaptive. ","We have identified the need to be the lack of access to resources, and we address it by providing a physical space that is equipped to cater to the needs of our users. We additionally propose adopting workshops that are designed to address challenges that maker’s face in their design, use of software, and use of equipment. We have actualized student initiated workshops in our FabLab that catered towards communal needs and demand. These workshops were successful in student’s satisfaction and productivity. Equivalently, implementing short intro classes as well as bridge classes into our curriculum can prove favorable to the career path and success of students, faculty, and other space users. The inclusion of such classes is perceived to be desired opportunities for community members as well as for industry partners. ","Engineering and advanced manufacturing is a priority sector established by our region. By equipping our students to discover and broaden their interest within these industries we alleviate the demand to the labor force as well as we stimulate local entrepreneurship. We are certain that by enabling people to the equipment and resources offered in maker’s spaces, opportunities for monetary compensation and lucrative employment opportunities increases. "
"Funding this project will regionalize a Workforce Education Research Center (WERC) (Ideally this should be across both LA and Orange counties; however, the center will start with the 19 Los Angeles County regional colleges). The primary objective of WERC is to bridge the gap between county economic/workforce demand data and the workforce supply in order to increase alignment and inform regional workforce education, practice, and policy; the required and preferred occupational competencies necessary for instructional course/program development; the county’s economic growth; and social justice issues that impact students and the workforce. Social justice issues could include educational attainment of populations in sub-regions of the county, wage parity, and negative impacts of sub-regional economic development such as gentrification.
The LAWERC (pronounced L.A. Work) will:
1.	Research and publish labor market supply and demand data informed by industry sector/cluster analysis, along with the industry specific staffing patterns and human capital supply chains, in relation to workforce education in the region. Industry sector/cluster analysis will be informed by and co-researched with Los Angeles Economic Development Corporation (LAEDC), the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, and other county workforce stakeholders.
2.	Provide research to inform the identification of employers necessary for regional industry advisory groups in order to apprise colleges of necessary occupational skills, workforce education performance objectives, workforce education performance criterion, and potentially inform a regional model curriculum and program design for regional adoption, program development, or program modification. 
3.	Research and publish regional studies focused on the impact, relationship, correlation, etc. that local, regional, and statewide workforce education and other policies have on educational access, social mobility, socio-economic status, social justice/classism, student success, workplace success/persistence, etc.  
","The project primarily focuses on informing and developing regional curriculum and the development of regional programs. Additionally, the project will inform policy and practice in workforce education through established relationships with the LAEDC, the Southern California Leadership Council, the LA Chamber of Commerce and others. LAWERC will facilitate the LAOCRC shifting from a reactive model of program approval to a proactive one. The current Center of Excellence for Labor Market Research (COE) would continue; however, it will become a partner to the larger LAWERC where it assists to bridge the gap between demand and supply in the county. LAWERC will partner with the COE, LAEDC, colleges, DSNs, faculty, and regional WDBs to identify high demand, high growth, low supply occupations and occupational clusters in the region in order to develop robust occupational competencies and programs needed for county economic viability and class mobility of its residents. The project aims to decrease time of program development through the regionalization of program curriculum.","The primary objective of the LAWERC is to bridge the gap between county workforce demand and supply data in order to increase alignment and inform regional workforce education, practice, and policy, the required and preferred occupational competencies necessary for instructional course/program development, the county’s economic needs, and social justice issues that impact students and the workforce.","The COE and LAEDC will assist with identifying the scope of a LA county community college regional response to market demands (# of colleges, who/where) and the recommended existing regional resources to be leveraged. Regional model curriculum, occupational performance objectives, and/or competencies will be developed based upon the research of the LAWERC. 
LAWERC will partner with the LAOC COE, LAEDC, colleges, DSNs, faculty, and regional WDBs to identify high demand, high growth, low supply occupations and occupational clusters to inform the development of robust occupational competencies and programs needed for county economic growth and class mobility of its residents. Similar program approval paths would be developed for: high demand, high growth and strong supply (multiple colleges already have similar programs w/ curricular alignment) and low  demand occupations with low/zero supply or emergent occupations. 
","There are currently 28 instructional programs among the LA County colleges where 10 or more colleges have a similar program. Most important is that often these programs each have very unique curriculum (objectives, units, courses, targeted credentials) yet are only 10-15 miles apart geographically. The region has set a goal to begin regionalizing key advisories and ultimately core curriculum under the LAWERC project in partnership with key colleges, key faculty, and DSNs. The goal is to regionalize 2-3 industry advisories during this project’s initial funded term in order to regionalize curriculum, occupational performance objectives, and competencies.   "

"1.	Increase testing capacity for EMT and Paramedic Students. 
Problem:  Too few testing sites is causing a backlog, thus students are having to wait a long time to test (up to three months for paramedic) or travel long distances (we have heard that some students have traveled to San Diego for a testing slot.)
2.	Increase capacity around new testing standards for fire fighter-1.
Problem: New testing standards now require addition instructor training as well as equipment to cover the battery of exams.  Most colleges that have FF-1 academies need PD funds or equipment funds to provide the new testing.
3.	Scale model K-14 pathways specific to law enforcement/DOJ clearance careers (law enforcement officers, probation officers, corrections officers, district attorneys, etc.). 
Problem: On-boarding students to law enforcement careers is becoming more challenging as more and more applicants do not meet background criteria.  There are model pathways for LE careers that could be scaled.
4.	Explore new and emerging for Law, Fire and EMS.
Problem: Some colleges are exploring/developing a Homeland Security degree/program, but need support around “new and emerging” industries.

Santa Barbara nonprofits produce $1.13 billion in revenue including $430 million in contributions and have $2.07 billion in assets. Our nonprofits generate 8.4% of Santa Barbara County’s GDP representing the highest rate in Southern California. These organizations spend $992 million including $342 million in personnel expenses—making the nonprofit sector one of the largest employers in the County. Santa Barbara has twice the number of nonprofits per capita as compared to the average for California, second only to Marin County. Clearly, we have good reason to highly value our vibrant nonprofit sector. Distribution of nonprofit budget size reveals another interesting piece of the story. Most of these 2,000 organizations (82 percent) have budgets of less than $1million, 12 percent come in at between $1 and $5 million, leaving only 6 percent at $5 million and above. Not surprisingly, many of the smaller and mid-sized organizations struggle with cost efficiencies relative to their economy of scale. ","Because of this high level of complexity, boards and executives are looking for improved ways to fulfill their mission. Some organizations are finding that collaboration and strategic alliances provide a platform for services of higher quality and broader scope. Others choose the path of merger to achieve higher cost efficiency. Many nonprofit executives looking for ways to enhance their effectiveness are seeking graduates from certificate programs for nonprofit management.","The LMI data demonstrates growth in local jobs in these areas of nonprofit operations management, and customer service. SBCC currently does not offer programs in these areas and yet the data indicates job growth and industry needs. ","Our region has established a priority of serving industry training needs to maximize job opportunities for students.

Currently each school district is doing its own version of career pathways, and some do not yet coordinate with community colleges.  Not all programs offer work-based learning or integrate work readiness into the coursework.  Students get different levels of access to programs across the region, depending on where they live.  Because there is considerable student mobility around the region, it is critical that students have portable credentials and courses so that they can continue on their pathway if they have to change schools.
SB 1070 CTE Regional Pathways was launched in 2014. Industry sectors supported through the program include health, biotechnology/life sciences, information and communication technologies/digital media, advanced transportation and renewables, advanced manufacturing, small business, and global trade & logistics. SB 1070 CTE Regional Pathways supports career pathway programming in San Diego and Imperial Counties through: 1) Alignment of CTE curriculum with high school career technical education curriculum, 2) Alignment of articulation and matriculation processes, 3) Career readiness and work-based learning opportunities for students, 4) Professional development for teachers and counselors, 5) Marketing to students and parents, 6) Data collection and evaluation, and 7) Productive partnerships between high school CTE programs, postsecondary educational institutions, and emerging regional businesses and industries.
The San Diego/Imperial region has two CCPT grants working to develop career pathways in specific sectors: 
The San Diego County College and Career Readiness Consortium (CCRC) was launched in 2014 as a regional approach to implementing the California Career Pathways Trust (CCPT) grant. The school partners in the CCPT grant are 16 districts with high-schools, one charter school, and the region's five community college districts.  The purpose of the CCPT project is to provide infrastructure investment to support the development of key components of a regional system to ensure delivery of streamlined, coordinated, sequenced career pathway curricula aligned to industry needs. Industry sectors targeted through the application include Advanced Manufacturing, Clean Energy, and Information and Communication Technologies. CCRC supports career pathway programming county-wide through: 1) A regional, online work-based learning portal to broker work-based learning opportunities, 2) Work-based learning teams to build the portal, 3) Professional development for teachers and counselors, 4) Curriculum alignment and development, 5) Marketing to students and parents, 6) Data collection and evaluation, and 7) Meaningful industry engagement with facilitation from the United Way of San Diego County. Such activities support the advancement of CCPT objectives.
In their CCPT grant, Imperial Valley College is partnering with IVROP, the Imperial County Office of Education Alternative Education program and five local high school districts to offer students in their junior year of high school the opportunity to earn college credit in the fields of Administration of Justice and Allied Health.  By the time they graduate from high school, students seeking careers in Administration of Justice will have 12 units of the 60 units needed for an Associate of Arts Transfer degree. Students in health fields will have the capability to obtain certification as either an Emergency Medical Technician, Home Health Aide or Certified Nursing Assistant during the summer of their senior year.
This proposal will develop a system that provides methodology and a template to develop career pathways in all industry areas.  It will develop an e-portal and related technology that will work for community colleges; CCPT is using the CCC Foundation portal, which has been designed mainly for K-12 uses, rather than for community colleges.  The project also will develop communications strategies to encourage students to pursue their career pathways at the community colleges.  The objective is to develop a better system to feed prepared students to community college programs.  The project will create coordinated pathways across the high school and community college systems; moving from a series of courses to actual pathways with work-based learning incorporated in them.. The project will work to leverage the CCPT and SWP funding.  The colleges have used SB 1070 funds to develop work-based learning activities, which will be integrated into the pathways developed through this project.
","Comprehensive interviews and surveys of thousands of employers in the region gave the region an insight into the jobs that can be filled with an associate degree or postsecondary certificate. Regional partners conducted analysis of the projected demand for middle-skill occupations and available supply of trained workers.  The analysis showed an undersupply of workers in the region in the following occupational groups: Office & administrative support; Health care practitioners and technical occupations (San Diego only); Sales & related; Installation, maintenance and repair; Construction & extraction; Production (San Diego only); Transportation & material moving; Life, physical & social science (San Diego only); Community & social services; Legal (San Diego only); Health care support; Personal care & service; Education, training & library; and Food preparation & serving (Imperial only).  
Utilizing the findings from multiple sector studies, regional partners identified several cross-sector employer needs/priorities.  These priorities include the need for workers with strong soft skills – communication, professionalism, team work, critical thinking, problem solving, etc.  In addition, previous work experience is key for many well-paying middle-skill occupations. Technical skills are required to respond to the latest innovations and technological changes, and many employers look for industry-based certifications are an indicator to employers of a job candidate’s technical proficiency. Regional employers have difficulties finding qualified employees and are interested in new ways to find and cultivate new talent. 
This proposal meets the needs of the labor market by focusing student preparation on the most in demand occupations that offer a living wage.
","This proposal identifies and addresses the identified needs by creating a system to guide development of career pathways in all industry areas, implementing an e-portal and related technologies, and implementing communication strategies.
The Career Pathways and Work-based Learning Project will be informed by the CCCCO Guided Pathways Initiative which is designed to substantially increase the number of students who earn a certificate or degree at a California Community College; it’s intent is to help design and implement structured academic and career pathways for all students.  The Guided Pathway model provides a structured framework for colleges to lead institutional change and improve student success by weaving together current reform initiatives into an integrated, institution-wide approach to student success. The model helps colleges clarify paths to student end goals, helps student select a program and stay on path, and ensures quality learning.
","The Southern Border Region Workforce Development Planning group established nine common tenets and workforce priorities during the planning of the four-year regional plan required under the Strong Workforce Program and the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA).  These include:
1.	The Regional Workforce Development System is more than the programs we fund:  Each of the stakeholders manage individual programs, infrastructure, and investments. Our vision is to connect these programs to create a more unified, integrated workforce development system. Programs change lives, but systems have the power to transform communities.  
2.	Shared Labor Market Data: The Southern Border workforce stakeholders will collaborate on sector research and reports, creating a common vision/agreement on which sectors/occupations to invest in, reduce duplication, and to align the direction of our collective investments.    
3.	Creating Opportunity for ALL residents of San Diego and Imperial Counties through better-defined career pathways: Our dual mission of regional prosperity and income mobility for the hardest to serve do not have to be mutually exclusive. Our job is not finished with just job placement. We must go further by creating and supporting career pathways to careers that offer family sustaining wage and room for professional growth for ALL communities. 
4.	Human-centered approach to service design: We must organize services around customer needs, not programmatic requirements.  Whether it is employers, adult jobseekers, or youth, our focus should not be on programs, it should be on people.
5.	Single entry point for business customers: Today, the public workforce system engages employers by program, with different people from different organizations calling employers to hire their participants. We change this by taking a “demand driven” approach to business services. San Diego’s public workforce system must engage businesses by sector under a common strategy with a coordinated sales force.   
6.	Increase service access points: Through co-location, service integration with system partners, and the development of meaningful remote access points, we must create more on-ramps into the public talent development system. Through co-location with partners, development of affiliate sites, better on-line and mobile friendly service offerings, and other strategies, we must increase the accessibility or program services.  
7.	Common definition of work-readiness: Businesses want a way to measure and understand job-readiness and essential skills in addition to the technical skills. We must all agree on a common, nationally-recognized career readiness certificate (such as the ACT National Career Readiness Certificate) for all jobseekers and students coming out of our programs, schools, and job centers. 
8.	Less money spent on bricks and mortar, more invested in people: Through shared and leveraged infrastructure, integrated staffing models, and expanded use of technology, system-stakeholders must reduce money spent on bricks and mortar and invest more in people.   
9.	Efficiency and measurable continuous improvement: Ineffective tactics will hinder well-thought out strategies.  We must continuously improve the system’s processes, policies, and professionalism while maintaining our commitment to transparency to achieve the vision and intent of WIOA.   
This proposal directly addresses the third strategic priority in this list, creating opportunity for ALL in the region through better-defined career pathways.  Participants in the regional planning process noted that our dual mission of regional prosperity and income mobility for the hardest to serve do not have to be mutually exclusive. Our job is not finished with just job placement. We must go further by creating and supporting career pathways to careers that offer family sustaining wage and room for professional growth for ALL communities.

"The long-term objective for this project is to develop and implement a regional marketing plan to promote SDICCCA CTE programs, with local implementation tools and options, utilizing a contracted marketing firm. Steps include (a) prioritization of target CTE programs and audiences; (b) application of media formats proven most effective for each audience; (c) development of a common branding and outreach campaign to promote high-demand careers and community college educational/training options; (d) cost-benefit analysis of participating in the CCCCO statewide CTE marketing effort and leveraging state matching funds; and (e) an evaluation plan to measure marketing effectiveness.  In the short-term while the regional marketing campaign is under development, the project will provide one-time funding of $50,000 per college to support local CTE marketing efforts.","CTE's share of statewide community college enrollment (FTES) declined from 31.3% in 2000/2001 to 28.2% in 2013/2014.  While non-CTE FTES increased 16.2% during this time period, CTE FTES remained about the same.  Overall, in years when total FTES increases, the percentage increase for CTE tends to be lower than for non-CTE.  In years when total FTES decreased, the percentage decrease in CTE tends to be greater than for non-CTE.   This pattern has been observed in the San Diego/Imperial region as well as statewide. 
The colleges in the San Diego/Imperial region seek to increase enrollments in their CTE programs.  However, each college does its own marketing of its career technical education programs to students (with publication in the class schedule often the only CTE marketing effort).  There is no cohesive, coherent message to all students and potential students in the region.   The State Chancellor's office has retained the services of renowned public relations firm Ogilvie to do an environmental scan and set a path forward on to deploy up to $3 million of state funds.  This project aims to ensure that the San Diego/Imperial regional plan is coordinated with that plan.
In addition, the public workforce system engages employers by program, with different people from different organizations calling employers to hire their participants.  Each college does its own marketing of its career technical education programs to employers; there is no cohesive, coherent message to all employers in the region.  
","CTE enrollments have been in decline throughout the region over the past decade.  However, the gap between job openings and the availability of qualified applicants is expected to increase to over one million jobs statewide by 2025.  The number of students enrolling in CTE programs in the region and statewide is not expected to fill that gap.  Strong Workforce Program local funds will provide additional CTE training opportunities, but students must learn that they are available and that they offer the ability to earn a living wage.
In addition, regional partners identified several cross-sector employer needs/priorities by utilizing the findings from multiple sector studies.  The top priority is for workers with strong soft skills – communication, professionalism, critical thinking, problem solving, etc.  These soft skills make the difference in securing and retaining employment; previous work experience also is key for many well-paying middle-skill occupations, and employers across sectors report the need for more experienced workforce. Regional employers have difficulties finding qualified employees and are interested in new ways to find and cultivate new talent.  They indicate that industry-based certifications are an indicator to employers of a job candidate’s technical proficiency.  While some businesses surveyed (particularly in advanced manufacturing) indicated a strong interest in partnering with the community colleges for internships and company tours, many were not aware of the training programs that the community colleges offer or how they could partner with the colleges to find a qualified work force.
","This proposal addresses the identified needs by hiring a marketing firm to develop a regional marketing plan focused on increasing both student and employer involvement in the community colleges, implementing that regional plan, and providing an interim allocation to the participating colleges to enable them to continue their own marketing program while the regional marketing program is under development.","The Southern Border Region Workforce Development Planning group established nine common tenets and workforce priorities during the planning of the four-year regional plan required under the Strong Workforce Program and the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA).  This proposal directly addresses several of these priorities: connecting programs to create a more unified, integrated workforce development system; implementing a more human-centered approach; and coordinating industry engagement and developing a single entry point for employer partners."
"Provide critical information (e.g., labor market, demand and supply, student outcomes data), analysis, and training for evidence-based decision-making for our region by expanding the capacity of the San Diego Imperial region Center of Excellence for Labor Market Research (COE).","The Centers of Excellence (COE) aspire to be the leading source of regional workforce information and insight for California Community Colleges. As a grant-funded technical assistance provider, the COE work with colleges, regions and the sector networks to: (a) Identify opportunities and trends in high growth, emerging, and economically critical industries and occupations; (b) Estimate the gap between labor market demand, available training, and existing or future workers; (c) Help regions respond to workforce needs by providing them quality information for decision-making.
COE funds only one position for the San Diego/Imperial region, making it difficult for colleges to access the information they need in a timely manner.  
","The Centers of Excellence deliver regional workforce research and technical expertise to California Community Colleges for program decision making and resource development.  This research and technical expertise include: 
•	Gap Analysis Reports match current and projected employment needs to the regional training supply, identify workforce gaps or oversupply and offer recommendations for alignment.
•	Environmental Scans provide a comprehensive overview for assessing industry trends, occupational needs and training supply, and usually include primary data collection.
•	Key Findings review and highlight significant findings from employer surveys or environmental scans. Short and to-the-point, Key Finding documents are designed for quick reference.
•	Labor Market Assessments provide an overview of the local labor market or college service area for high level planning and strategic development.
•	Research Briefs are customized for COE clients and vary in length and content.
•	Consultation and Technical Expertise is available to assist in the interpretation and application of data and research findings. The COE also provides input to organizations about data applications and tools that give community colleges better access to labor market information.
","This project will provide additional funding to the San Diego Imperial region COE to enable it to hire more staff and expand the services provided.  These expanded services will provide data/analysis support for our local colleges and the region including the following:
•	Update regional labor market assessment reports for middle-skill occupations in San Diego and Imperial counties annually; fall 2017, fall 2018.
•	Provide consultation and training to regional colleges to explain labor market information, sources and gap analysis as needed.
•	Retrieve customized labor market data for emerging occupations through the use of Burning Glass and other data sources.
•	Support regional projects with data and research.
•	Participate in regional Curriculum Program Endorsement process.
•	Support the San Diego and Imperial ""Southern Border"" Regional Workforce Development Plan
","The Southern Border Region Workforce Development Planning group established nine common tenets and workforce priorities during the planning of the four-year regional plan required under the Strong Workforce Program and the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA).  The nine priorities are:
1.	The Regional Workforce Development System is more than the programs we fund:  Each of the stakeholders manage individual programs, infrastructure, and investments.

The proposed project will directly address the second of these key priorities: Shared Labor Market Data. The Southern Border workforce stakeholders will collaborate on sector research and reports, creating a common vision/agreement on which sectors/occupations to invest in, reduce duplication, and to align the direction of our collective investments.

"This project will identify research-based criteria to support development of innovative, regionally focused, multi-district partnership projects that promote Strong Workforce Program goals and have a strong impact on student success and meeting workforce needs in the region (such as new certificate/degree programs, inclusion of external credentials, regional curriculum review, regional alignment of existing programs, and partnerships with other regional entities).","While each college in the region is doing its own CTE program development, the region's needs may not be addressed.  Based on input from employers regarding the difficulty they experience in finding new hires with soft and job readiness skills, it may be concluded that colleges are not meeting employer workforce needs.  Currently each school district is doing its own version of career pathways, and some do not yet coordinate with community colleges.  Collaborating colleges can be funded to work with faculty to align curriculum with the same CTE programs in the region, improving access to career pathways and providing a clearer guide to employers wishing to hire graduating students. 
Not all programs offer work-based learning or integrate work readiness into the coursework.  Collaborating colleges could be funded to develop a stronger, regional work-based learning component for their CTE program.  Based on regional LMI analysis, program gaps (especially in emerging fields) need to be responded to as a region.  Partnering colleges can be funded to research this new/modified CTE opportunity, determine scope, develop the curriculum with industry input, and agree on which colleges should offer the program.  Finally, the region's colleges agreed that we need to take a careful, considered approach to developing projects that address these regional needs.  Colleges need adequate time to plan, so that the investments made are well spent.  Therefore, this project provides for adequate planning to confirm the priorities, process, proposal applications and rubrics for scoring.
","Comprehensive interviews and surveys of thousands of employers in the region gave the region an insight into the jobs that can be filled with an associate degree or postsecondary certificate. Regional partners conducted analysis of the projected demand for middle-skill occupations and available supply of trained workers.  The analysis showed an undersupply of workers in the region in the following occupational groups: Office & administrative support; Health care practitioners and technical occupations (San Diego only); Sales & related; Installation, maintenance and repair; Construction & extraction; Production (San Diego only); Transportation & material moving; Life, physical & social science (San Diego only); Community & social services; Legal (San Diego only); Health care support; Personal care & service; Education, training & library; and Food preparation & serving (Imperial only).  
Utilizing the findings from multiple sector studies, regional partners identified several cross-sector employer needs/priorities:
1.	Regional employers have difficulties finding qualified employees and are interested in new ways to find and cultivate new talent. This is especially true for small businesses who may not have a human resources department or professional. Employers do not have a lot of time to search for the perfect candidate and are open to new ideas for finding job candidates.
2.	Workers with strong soft skills are essential for businesses to succeed. The number one skill requested by employers across all sectors are the soft skills – communication, professionalism, critical thinking, problem solving, etc.
3.	Soft skills make the difference in securing and retaining employment. Like the point above, if a job candidate can prove their soft skills to an employer, they have a much higher likelihood of retaining employment.
4.	Previous work experience is key for many well-paying middle-skill occupations. Previous work experience offers a lot of insight to employers without even meeting a candidate. It shows that the candidate has both technical and soft skills required for the position, as they have successfully held a previous position. Work experience gives a leg-up when the competition is tight for a position.
5.	Technical skills are required to respond to the latest innovations and technological changes. With a quickly changing technologic world, it is important for workers to keep up with new technologies for companies to remain competitive in the economy. 
6.	Industry-based certifications are an indicator to employers of a job candidate’s technical proficiency. Certifications are a great way for employers to know right off the bat what skills an individual possesses. Many certifications are approved through the state of California, resulting in a state-wide inventory of those individuals who possess a certain certificate.
7.	Small businesses have few jobs posted online, and instead rely on word-of-mouth to hire new employees. While most aspects of business have moved online, the job market is still a low-tech area. Instead of hiring an unknown individual based on a resume and interview, employers can utilize existing employees for referrals, which may be more reliable for finding new workers.
8.	Imperial County’s economy is strongly tied to the border region and cross-border trade with Mexico. While both San Diego and Imperial Counties share a border with Mexico, and trade is an important sector in both counties, Imperial County’s economy relies on trade with Mexico to a much greater extent.  This creates a unique opportunity in the area for innovative solutions.
9.	Many students are completing programs/graduating with degrees; however, the quality of the labor supply is unknown – this is an area for further evaluation and study. The Priority Sector Initiatives report compiles nearly 500 workforce initiatives, including hundreds of education and training programs; however, their effectiveness can be studied to determine if training gaps have, in fact, been addressed by the initiatives, or if program improvement or new programs are necessary to fill those gaps.
The proposed projects may address any of these needs and priorities on a regional basis, based on collaborating colleges' analysis of regional needs and best practices to address them.
","This proposal addresses the identified needs by giving college faculty time to carefully and thoughtfully develop projects that implement new programs, processes and systems to meet the identified needs. This project will identify research-based criteria to support development of multi-district partnership projects that promote SWP goals and have a strong impact on student success and meeting workforce needs in the region (such as new certificate/degree programs, inclusion of external credentials, regional curriculum review, regional alignment of existing programs, partnerships with other regional entities).","The Southern Border Region Workforce Development Planning group established nine common tenets and workforce priorities during the planning of the four-year regional plan required under the Strong Workforce Program and the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA).

"The ""Technology Innovation Collaboration"" is a regional initiative between Laney College and Berkeley City College, Oakland Unified School District, community based organizations, and private industry partnering to establish a full-stack technology pipeline. The goal of the initiative is to build on the success of Career Pathway Trust and Dual Enrollment programs taking place at both Laney College and Berkeley City College to create a pipeline that provides access to the employment opportunities available in the East-Bay and Bay Area region. The rich learning pathway will support incumbent workers, high school students, and working professionals providing employer focused training, educational support, and outreach to diverse students.","The proposal addresses the need for a clear, affordable, and accessible technology pipeline.  Skilled Information Communication Technology (ICT) workers are in high demand throughout the country, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area. The San Francisco Bay Region has a global and disruptive economy that, for technology and digital media careers, both destabilizes the workforce and creates opportunities for workers who can nimbly pivot, re-purpose and enhance their skills to meet businesses’ emerging needs. The resulting job churn places strains on individuals affected by frequent layoffs, the education/career training system, which must keep up with fast-changing skills; and businesses, which struggle to find appropriately skilled talent.

"This project will develop a regional strategy to market CTE to various constituencies, including students, parents, community, business and industry, workforce and the media. The project is not designed to fully fund the marketing plans for each individual college, but instead to develop a regional strategy; however, colleges can leverage this project with their local fund plans that address their unique needs. Strategies include the development of online content for websites and social media, media ads/kits, showcase events (demonstrations, competitions and regional fairs and other events) and the branding of regional CTE education in the region.  Funds in this project will also be used to provide resources for the exploration of industry-driven innovations to address needs that might emerge during the performance period, especially those identified by the LAEDC, the LA Area Chamber of Commerce, workforce or business/industry partners and the Southern California Leadership Council. ","While colleges have varying marketing and outreach strategies that are developed based on their unique needs and capacity, there is not a coordinated regional effort to market Career Technical Education.  This includes the need to increase awareness of CTE, showcase careers, jobs and career ladders, and highlight the work of CTE students in the region.  What marketing has been done does not appeal to the 21st century learner and we need to increase the use of social media and visual media platforms.","Colleges in the region face a number of challenges in preparing students. According to studies by the Milken Institute, JPMorgan Chase and the Centers of Excellence, the supply of middle-skills workers currently being produced is not enough to meet the demand of employers. California, and Los Angeles specifically, must significantly increase the number of workers with industry-relevant, middle-skill degrees, credentials and certificates.   In order to meet this regional labor market need, more individuals need to be recruited and trained.","This marketing strategy will employ multiple strategic methods to increase the number of individuals being trained in the myriad of CTE programs offered in the region, to better understand the in demand occupation and high growth industries and promote the value proposition that community colleges and CTE represent.   Further, CTE will be highlighted as exciting and intriguing opportunities for growth through regional events, showcases, competitions and media campaigns.  The focus will be on marketing CTE as educational option.  ","Regional Priorities Addressed:
1. Maximizing sustained industry engagement; 
3. Expanding opportunities for work-based learning; 
6. Supporting regional marketing curriculum alignment streamlined regional processes as well as regional labor market data collection and analysis for data-informed decision making.

Strong Workforce Recommendations: 1 and 3

"
"Implementation of Career Pathways is a major focus of the Strong Workforce Recommendations.  This project would provide technical assistance and staffing that would continue the work of the SB 1070 Career Pathways Grant.  The current grant sunsets June 2017, but funding is needed for the 2017-18 Academic Year.  Focus will be on 1.  Implementation of Alternative Methods for Granting Credit from High School and/or Adult Education; 2.  Implementation of CATEMA to track credit granting from high school/adult education; 3.  Implementation of Dual Enrollment Courses that focus on identified Career Pathways.  The Career Specialist will be the point of contact for articulation, dual enrollment and development of career pathways between the community colleges and High School/Adult School.   Funding will provide for:  10-month employee at each of the 19 colleges, Project Director Contract, Project Coordinator (part time), Clerical Support, Web Hosting for www.lacccwc.com with link to www.laocrc.org., Staff Development for Counselors at High Schools, Adult Schools, & Community Colleges, and Meeting Expenses ","The community colleges in Los Angeles County have developed policies and procedures for the development and implementation of Career Pathways including Articulation of courses/programs from high school/adult education to the community colleges.  This was accomplished with SB 1070 Career Pathways funding.  Having the foundation in place, staff are now needed to accomplish this goal as identified in the Strong Workforce ","During the 15-16 school year, the eighteen LA Co. Community colleges developed the necessary policies and procedures for implementation of Career Pathways with participation from all colleges.  This included articulation of courses between the high school/adult school and offering of Dual Enrollment courses under both AB 288 Agreements and non AB 288 Agreements.  Implementation is at various levels among the colleges.  Within the LA Co Ring Colleges, there exists 461 credit career pathways.  However, only 124 are aligned with high school/ adult education programs.  Data for the LACCD Colleges is not available at this time.  At the high school, CTE lacks support,  and the focus has been on four-year post-secondary education.  High School staff has expressed frustration with trying to identify how a CTE course offered to high school students can align with the college Career Pathways.  Over three hundred high schools exist within the LA County region; creating a challenge as to whom the community colleges should work.  Currently, no dedicated staff exists at the community colleges to provide this outreach service.  Therefore, a more formal and structural approach needs to be developed to ensure that all of the high schools are served.
 
This proposal will provide the needed support for Workforce Development/CTE staff at each of the colleges in Los Angeles County.  Additionally, regional activities will provide the support and sharing of models that will facilitate a more similar structure throughout the region.

","The need for developing and revising career pathways to ensure alignment with the high school/adult education as well as Workforce Development Boards needs is a challenging assignment; one that cannot be “tacked on” faculty, instruction deans, or workforce development staff.  It is systematic process that needs full time attention to be successful.  Currently, the only resources available to the community colleges is the Perkins Transition dollars.  These limited dollars do not provide for a full time staff member who can build a relationship with the feeder CTE programs in the service area.  Likewise, these funds do not allow for on-going funding.  The Strong Workforce dollars do not have these same restrictions and this proposal would achieve that.","Regional Priorities Addressed:

The Strong Workforce Recommendation # 3 focuses on the need for the community colleges to establish clearly defined career pathways originating in either the high school and/or adult education and leading to entry level employment.  The CCCCO definition of a Career Pathway is currently under development under the leadership of CCCAOE.   The Los Angeles County community colleges adopted the elements established by Department of Labor and the Workforce Development Boards.  These seven elements will be the framework for the development of career pathways in this region. 

One of the major priorities for Los Angeles County is to align curriculum offered at the high school/ adult education courses with community college programs.  The Workforce Development Boards have also been mandated to enroll students in courses that lead to higher level certificates and degrees.  This proposal would collect and post on a searchable web site all CTE Career Pathway programs to assist with identifying entry points as well as to identify site where offered.  It would enable Los Angeles County community colleges to communicate in a systematic manner, serving the entire region.

"The CTE Regional Internship & Jobs Academy (RIJA) provides the Los Angeles/Orange County Regional Consortia students with dedicated Sector-Based Work-Based Learning Coordinators (WBLCs) with expertise in their respective industries to act as an intermediary with HR Managers to develop a repository for real time openings and separations with existing employers and identified LMI occupational projections for local and regional TOP Code plans.  LA/OC students will be provided the opportunity to participate in monthly information sessions, opportunities to participate in region-wide internships, job placements, employer-led projects, campus-to-campus employer job fairs, etc. Most of these activities will be planned and executed on college campuses, community partner sites, and employers’ worksites.  The WBLCs would be responsible for meeting milestones that are aligned with program goals around internships, jobs, and other non-classroom activities that acclimate students to the industry and workplace; and work directly with the DSNs to develop an inventory on existing employer partners and expanding beyond the existing employer partnerships.  A CTE Regional Internship Academy Jobs Board would be developed where students can upload job portfolios, resumes, milestones on work-based learning completions and certificate/degree completion in response to job openings. The Job Board would be linked to the LAOCRC website and maintained by a dedicated person who would receive updates from the WBLCs.","The Strong Workforce program funding criterion for 2016-2017 include “unemployment rates” metric and 2017-2018 will include “successful workforce outcomes” metric.

"The LAOCRC Regional Plan outcomes can be strengthened with the development of contextualized short-term noncredit bootcamps to better prepare students to enter college and be successful in credit CTE coursework.  Examples of contextualized noncredit bootcamps are Math for Health Careers, Vocational ESL, and preparation for college placement exams. The project seeks to include participation from regional noncredit faculty for the development of contextualized noncredit curriculum. There is also the potential to increase WIOA and Adult Education Block Grant outcomes by improving post-secondary transitions, employment, and certifications.  ","The SWP aims to train individuals for middle-skilled employment in high demand fields.

"The goal of this project is to develop an Entrepreneurial Mindset Across Disciplines in CTE fields, as well as STEM, that have the potential to yield business ownership, partnerships, and corporate entities.  There is a gap in contextualized small business/entrepreneurship certificates and degrees and a lack of experiential learning by doing.  Students who desire business as a career and starting their own businesses need more opportunities for work-based learning.  
There is opportunity for each campus, across their disciplines to:
•Embed and infuse small business/entrepreneurship curriculum into their programs/courses
•Create certificates and degrees with emphasis on small business/entrepreneurship
•Have work based learning opportunities through small business/entrepreneurship
","Today's students have come of age in a rapidly changing society where jobs are no longer guaranteed as the result of a college education, and where world politics have made a global society an undeniable fact of life.  Technological advances are also instigating enormous changes in the social and nonprofit sectors. To cope with this new and unpredictable world, students are best prepared with the combination of a liberal education and an entrepreneurial mindset who will be creative, adaptable, and able to think at higher levels of complexity. Contrary to the beliefs of many who grew up in the pre-technology boom of the mid-twentieth century, a liberal education is a practical solution to the changing needs and concerns of society. According to The Kauffman Entrepreneur Index Study by the Kauffman Foundation, California is 5th in the nation for entrepreneurial growth and 2nd for overall entrepreneurial activity. California’s small businesses comprise 98% of all businesses in the state, provide 82% of the private sector jobs, and 75% of the gross state product. According to data from the Employment Development Department (EDD) Labor Market Information Division (LMID), there are over 1.3 million small businesses (with 100 or fewer employees) that employee over 7.6 million people in California. According to Charles Eason, a Small Business Sector Navigator for Doing What MATTERS program, “Our focus is to infuse small business and entrepreneurship concepts into all of the various career and technical education disciplines so that students will have both the needed technical skills and the needed business skills to succeed in the workforce and to become future entrepreneurial leaders.” 

Examples of the need across disciplines is in career paths that lead to the nuts and bolts of operating a small business or becoming entrepreneurial:
•HEALTHCARE: a Home Health Aide becomes an independent sole proprietor meeting the needs of patients
•PSYCHOLOGY: a psychologist starts their own practice by opening up an office 
•CHILD DEVELOPMENT: A Child Development Specialist starts a Day Care Center operation
•ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE: a graduate uses his/her foundational training to become a Private Investigator with a small business operation
•CSIT: a student with stackable certificates in Support Services Technician starts his/her own business in troubleshooting computer issues for businesses
•ENGINEERING: a graduate takes his/her interest in architecture to become an engineering consultant in a new downtown building project
","Students, faculty, and community members enrolling in entrepreneur and small business certificates and programs are the target of this project.  The driving force in this project is the promotion of self-empowerment, personal development, the value of team - all strengthened by one's role in planning and executing the entrepreneurial vision that meets the global needs of the twenty-first century.

This broad-based academic discipline approach will serve as a preparation for life and career. The challenges of the new century demand these new perspectives, regardless of whether the sector is private or nonprofit, in the general academic or in the skilled pre-professional.  

The Entrepreneurial Mindset will focus outreach to a variety of enrollment targets and to faculty in the classroom:
•Students – K12
     -High School Business Academies
     -Dual Enrolled – 9th-12th grades
•College
     -CTE dept. students
     -STEM & Other Disciplines that promote business ownership
•Faculty
     -Across All Disciplines 
•Community
     -Introductory Workshops to promote campus programs/courses 

","The design of this program is: 
•Assessment of Entrepreneurial Mindset Index (EMI) measures
•Strategies for Small Business/Entrepreneurship enrollment growth
•Three-part training and professional development series for Students, Faculty, and Community members
•Entrepreneur Summer Camp for high school and college students
•Training Institute development to help aspiring entrepreneurs to meet a tangible goal toward operating a successful business
•Community College to University pathway promotion
•Entrepreneurs Summit for High School & College Youth, Counselors, Faculty, Administrators, and Industry professionals

"The Teacher Preparation Pipeline (TPP) – STEM/CTE Collaborative started in 2014-2015 when 10 TPP campuses came together and created a statewide collaborative.  This collaborative provides a model of contextualized teacher preparation that successfully recruits, trains and supports existing and future educators throughout the state of California, focusing on the areas of STEM and CTE.  Its focus includes career exploration, contextualized learning opportunities, teacher recruitment and retention, and the development of a quality teacher preparation model of collaboration that is currently shared regionally, statewide and beyond. It will focus on two major activities: 
1) enhancing professional development opportunities for CTE faculty to maintain industry and program relevance as part of the BOG Task Force Recommendations; and 
2) developing partnerships with K-12 districts to develop shared initiatives for increasing dual- enrollment opportunities for high school students interested in careers with children, increasing teacher pipeline activities, and jointly promoting teaching as a career. 
This TPP Collaborative project covers the following key criteria and projected outcomes: 
a)	Increasing Enrollment Potential 
b)	Developing Career Pathways (each participating college will work with 4–year university partners and K-12 districts to streamline career pathways that lead to teaching) 
c)	Preparing Students (e.g. career exploration, counseling, field work) 
d)	Preparing Job Seekers 
e)	Work-based Learning Opportunities  
f)	Broad Regional Focus (collaborative will convene all 19 colleges in the LA Region to work on projects with a regional focus)  
g)	Job Placement Function  
h)	New Curriculum Development  
i)	Addressing Gaps in Skill Development  
j)	Faculty Professional Development, and 
k)     Additional Template Metrics
*approx. 475 students enrolled in dual enrollment in Fall 2017
*based on 19 colleges in the LA region participating

A second component added to the TPP Collaborative project is the Santa Monica College Bilingual/STEM sub-project. This will prioritize career exploration, contextualized learning opportunities, teacher recruitment and retention, and the development of a quality teacher preparation pathway, by focusing on four activities: 
1) Provide professional development opportunities and or membership for Santa Monica CTE faculty to maintain industry and program relevance, (such as AAUW, CSTA). 
2) Strengthen partnerships with Santa Monica’s local school districts to develop shared initiatives for increasing dual- enrollment opportunities for high school students interested in careers with children, increasing teacher pipeline activities, and jointly promoting teaching as a career. 
3) Develop and implement Santa Monica’s university partnerships (such as UCLA, CSUDH. etc.) to streamline career pathways that lead to Bilingual / STEM teaching 
4) Build Santa Monica’s capacity and infrastructure to prepare students for teaching careers through: 
a)	Development of TMC in Elementary Teaching 
b)	Contextualizing general education courses 
c)	Offering dedicated Counseling activities 
d)	Develop pathway and marketing materials 
e)	Create and convene an Education Advisory committee 

A third component added to the TPP Collaborative project is the East Los Angeles College (ELAC) Pathway to Teaching sub-project. In this, ELAC will lead Teaching Credential Pathway between East Los Angeles College and California State University – Los Angeles (Cal-State LA). The credentialing pathway will include: work-based learning, College and Career readiness, and Professional Development; supporting the pathway with 21st Century technology and business application skills.
","Reports and news articles about a teacher shortage has inundated the news for the past years.  The Labor Market Information Division of the California Employment Development Department alone identified an estimated 51,500 openings for elementary school teachers and 31,100 jobs for secondary school teachers statewide between 2010 and 2020; with K-12 teaching being one of the top 10 best paid occupations and having the highest number of job openings (82,600), second only to nursing (99,800)  

A more recent report, Addressing California’s Teacher Shortage: An Analysis of Sources and Solutions, finds that the “increased demand for K–12 teachers in California comes at a time when the supply of new teachers is at a 12-year low.”  A decline in enrollment in teacher preparation programs (dropped by more than 70 percent over the last decade), and teacher attrition, specifically non-retirement attrition, which typically accounts for two-thirds of teachers who leave, are among the major factors affecting the supply and demand for teachers. 

The goal of the Teacher Preparation Pipeline –STEM/CTE is to positively impact the current teacher shortage through the sharing of resources, standardizing practices, and providing a quality model of teacher preparation at the regional level. It will focus on two major activities to address teacher recruitment/enrollment and teacher retention/attrition.

First, enhancing the professional development opportunities for STEM and CTE faculty to maintain program and/or industry relevance and improve teacher retention. Research shows that “turnover for beginners-who leave at much higher rates than other teachers-is influenced by how well novices are prepared prior to entry and how well they are mentored in the first years on the job.” 

Second, developing partnerships with K-12 districts and universities to develop shared initiatives for increasing dual and cross enrollment opportunities for students interested in teaching, increasing teacher pipeline activities and jointly promoting teaching as a career.

The purpose of the Teacher Preparation Pipeline –STEM/CTE Collaborative serves not one but all the emerging and priority industry sectors within the Doing What Matters framework as it responds to the pressing shortage of teachers in the state of California, particularly in the STEM and CTE fields.","It will address the pressing need of quality teachers in the LA region, particularly in the areas of STEM and CTE where the issues of recruitment/enrollment and retention/attrition are most acute.","The two identified needs in the Rationale Section deal with teacher recruitment/enrollment and retention/attrition.

"This was a collaboration of LA County Colleges electing to use CTE-Enhanced Funding for starting or augmenting a training program for biotech laboratory skills. Ideas were proposed and decisions were made on lab space, curriculum, career pathways and dual enrollment, advisory boards, marketing, alignment with new BS programs, internships, third-party credentials, employability milestones and industry alignment.
Project Objectives:  
#1 Increase training capacity at all collaborating colleges.  
#2 Create work-based learning and dual enrollment opportunities that will allow high school students and basic skills learners to choose a career in biosciences knowledgeably.  
#3 Facilitate the development of programs with industry-aligned curriculum using the experience of and shared curriculum from consortium faculty.  
#4 Market the opportunity of the bioscience consortium programs. 
#5 Align curriculum with BS Bio-manufacturing degrees (Solano, Mira Costa).
"," This proposal addresses the need for workforce development for the biosciences industry in Los Angeles County to solve a skills and employee gap in entry level jobs.

 ","ccording to the latest industry report Los Angeles has the largest employment (27,777) in the US in medical devices and third largest employment (22,365) in research, testing and medical labs. (Battelle – Teconomy 2016 report). 
According to a 2014 COE Report, Twenty-five percent (824) of the total job postings for entry level bioscience jobs in CA were in LA/OC.  The shortage of students supplied to the regional labor market may be as many as 245 per year in Los Angeles. Median wages in Los Angeles were between $17.34 and $31.36 for the top 6 job titles in the job postings.  The annual growth rate for these jobs over five years was 3%.  
This project will increase the training capacity of the community colleges in LA and decrease the supply/demand gap in the entry level jobs.

","Increasing training capacity by starting new programs and increasing the capacity and curriculum offerings of existing programs will create a larger supply of workers.  Increased dual enrollment and pathway offerings of work-based learning will attract more trainees to these programs from high schools.  Increased marketing of these training programs and the opportunity to achieve a BS in biomanufacturing at two colleges in CA will have a positive effect on enrollment.

By increasing the training capacity for entry level jobs in the biosciences industries we will be closing the skills and employment gap in LA and will be assisting the LA County Biosciences Taskforce Initiative and the LA Bioscience Hub Project backed by the LA County Supervisors, the City of Los Angeles, the LAEDC, the LA Chamber of Commerce and the three trade organizations currently operating in Los Angeles: Southern California Biomedical Council, BioCom and the California Life Sciences Association.","Regional Priorities Addressed:

"In order to best meet the needs of the Energy, Construction and Utilities sector, community colleges, industry and economic development partners in LA need to work together to develop a regional workforce plan. The project is Year One of a multi-year plan that will address the needs of the regional economy in this sector. The plan includes industry engagement, regional advisories, curriculum enrichment/enhancement, updated equipment, professional development, career awareness and pathway development, and new and incumbent worker training. ","According to the most recent LAEDC report, Los Angeles: People, Industry and Jobs for 2015 – 2020, as the housing market recovers, construction industries are expected to make a recovery, including many of the existing infrastructure projects that will employ thousands of workers in highway, transit, infrastructure and other projects. Finally, continuing incentives and mandates related to energy efficiency and greening of existing buildings have the potential to drive employment in retrofitting and energy efficient implementations. Together, the sector is projected to add more than 20,000 jobs between 2015 and 2020 in Los Angeles County and almost 7,000 jobs in the City of Los Angeles.  Energy Efficiency industry in particular faces serious shortfalls in developing a skilled, trained, and available labor pool over the next 20-30 years. According to the AEE-Advanced Energy Economy, nationwide an estimated additional 57,000 skilled workers are needed each year to work in the Energy Efficiency industry. California’s Advanced Energy industry needs highly skilled workers – 15,000 more of them every year.","The Energy, Construction and Utilities sector accounts for 11 community college programs in the county. There are 17 occupations in the county related to this sector.
On average, post-secondary programs conferred 778 awards each year.  In terms of the demand for workers, the 17 occupations will have 6,750 job openings over the next five years.  This program will increase those completions to better meet the demand in the region.  
","In order to best meet the needs of the Energy, Construction and Utilities sector, community colleges, industry and economic development partners in LA need to work together to develop a regional workforce plan.  The description of this project is Year One of a multi-year plan that will address the needs of the regional economy in this sector.  The plan includes industry engagement, regional advisories, curriculum enrichment/enhancement, updated equipment, professional development, career awareness and pathway development, and new and incumbent worker training.  
1. Industry engagement, college program scan and development of a regional industry advisory – Industry will be engaged in a process to evaluate how well the region’s education/training programs are aligned with industry needs. This involves not only looking at gaps between supply and demand, i.e. growth and replacement numbers compared to the pipeline (projected completers), but also looking at skills gaps and the need for up-skilling of the workforce.  
2. Enhanced and enriched curriculum and equipment – Based on the above analysis, the immediate and most critical needs for program enhancement and equipment upgrades will be addressed in Year One.  According to industry analysis and data, there are several areas of specific need for enriched program development and expanded industry certifications.  This might translate to the need for more colleges to offer the certificate and degree programs or for expanding the content of the curriculum and certificate programs that are currently offered.  This includes expanding the use of industry valued third party, evidence based, assessments and credentials.
3. Professional development - Faculty will need professional development and, in some cases, additional training to develop new course outlines and lesson plans and learn to use and teach with the new equipment purchased.  In some cases faculty will offered externships to further develop their skills.  Faculty externships will likely be developed and funded in Years 2 and 3. 
4. Increased Career Awareness and Career Pathway Development – Strengthening the pipeline must include strengthening the partnerships with K-12 and adult education partners.  The project will begin by having the colleges identify the related high school career pathway programs (STEM/STEAM Pathways, environmental/sustainability, and anything related to construction), and well as traditional education partners who are not yet aligned into pathways.   Young people have been overly conditioned to think of the trades as a lesser calling compared to the more popular career paths – this must be addressed.  The project will focus on strategies to engage students in engaging and innovative career awareness activities related to the sector, including online career awareness tools, videos, campus visits with hands-on activities and classroom presentations. 
5.  Work Experience and Internship - Having the opportunity to have hands-on experience in an industry setting is an important experience to increase the skills and job readiness of students.  Working closely with industry partners, the Chamber, workforce system and others, the Regional Workforce Plan will develop a repository for work experience and internships (paid and unpaid) in the region and a process to match qualified students. Electronic/online internship and placement systems will be evaluated (LaunchPath, Viridis, and others) for implementation in subsequent years.
6. Incumbent Worker Training – As a result of #1 above, industry will also have identified the need for current worker training and up-skilling.  To meet that need, colleges will work with industry to develop non-credit training to meet the specific needs of the industry partners engaged in the process.  ","Regional Priorities Addressed: 
1. Maximizing sustained industry engagement; 
2. Strengthening career pathways and programs of study;  
3. Expanding opportunities for work-based learning;  
4. Attending to the need for new CTE faculty recruitment and professional development and externships for current faculty; and 
5. Addressing the needs of business and industry in identified priority and emerging sectors.

"The HVAC/R collaborative has been very successful in bringing together colleges across regions in efforts to align curriculum and foster articulation. It should be enabled to continue to grow stronger in efforts to meet the new challenges of our industry such as ZNE ( Zero Net Energy).
Community College CTE courses have a responsibility to meet industry demands.  The state of California has set forth a stronger initiative with Zero Net Energy (ZNE) in the Residential sector by 2020 and the Commercial sector by 2030 for all new construction.  Installers, Technicians, and Operator/Managers will need to employ technical skills that will be a result of these initiatives. 
The California Energy Commission (CEC)  has identified the types of skills required such as Energy Analyst/Auditor, Commissioning Specialist/Agents that would impact our sector.  Incumbent workers will need to upskill for evolving technology, alternative energy mediums, and sustainability practices.
Labor Market Data, from CoE, indicates an annual job market demand of 576 persons annually in LA,OC,Inland Empire and Desert Sub Regions. This constitutes a 10% increase in LA County and 15% increase in Orange County.  This new labor force will also be impacted by the same challenges as listed for the incumbent worker above. 
The purpose and scope of this project is to provide the facility and technology, which can be utilized across the region, as well as showcase and research the energy and sustainability of ZNE.  The ZNE workforce has not been specifically defined yet, and it will be a mission of this project to aid in doing so.
","The HVAC/R collaborative was originally funded through CTE-EF and has been very successful in bringing together colleges across 3 regions in efforts to align curriculum and foster articulation. With Strong Workforce funding, the LA portion of the collaborative will continue to address those ongoing alignment and articulation efforts while working to meet the new challenges of the HVAC/R industry- particularly the Zero Net Energy (ZNE) regulations, which will require ZNE for all new construction in the Residential sector by 2020 and in the Commercial sector by 2030.  The collaborative must work with industry to define the skillset of ZNE technical workforce as applied to HVAC/R and Controls industries because incumbent workers (installers, technicians, and operator /managers) will need to up-skill for evolving technology, alternative energy mediums, and sustainability practices and our students will need to possess these skills upon program completion as well. ","Labor Market Data, from COE, indicates an annual job market demand of 576 persons in LA, OC, Inland Empire and Desert Sub Regions. This represents a 10% increase in LA County and 15% increase in Orange County.  ","This proposal has taken into account not only the current and projected labor market demand calculated by CoE, but also the demand that will increase exponentially in 2018 and beyond due to ZNE mandates.  ","Regional Priorities Addressed: 
1. Maximizing sustained industry engagement; 
2. Strengthening career pathways and programs of study;  
3. Expanding opportunities for work-based learning;  
4. Attending to the need for new CTE faculty recruitment and professional development and externships for current faculty; and

"The goal of the GTL Regional project of two large counties (LA & Orange), 10 colleges, 1 AJCC, 4 DSNs, a regional advisory of 16 large and small business (LA Ports, LA World Airport, UPS, Tesla), and DSNs from Global Trade & Entrepreneurship is to transform student experiences in program, projects, and job opportunities.  The colleges include, LA Southwest, LA Harbor, Santa Monica,  Santa Ana, West LA, Mt. SAC, Pasadena, Glendale, LA Mission, Long Beach and Compton.  The AJCC is at Willshire/Compton in LA and the DSNs represent Los Angeles and Orange County in Global Trade & Logistics and Small Business & Entrepreneurship.  Planned projects include, GTL Curriculum Development & Articulation of sequenced curriculum of Industry-Themed Pathways. A GTL Career EXPO will bring professionals, employers, ports, commerce, students, workforce groups, and colleges together for career and job opportunities for students.  A Regional Advisory of industry sector leaders, businesses and employers, education, workforce, and students will champion the cause and focus of work-based learning, internships, and jobs for our students (high school and college).  We will host a CoffeeHouse Industry Series of mini-workshops that rotate to each of our campuses every other month throughout the year and an Industry Spotlight Series as student information sessions with outreach to academies, linked learning schools and college international business, general business and entrepreneur majors. We will continue with the IBEA program & website for regional Global / International Business information, programs.  The LA County WIB Transportation and Logistics Intermediary Project will continue to convene businesses and educators to access needs, training capacity, and gaps, and make recommendations on training investments and program priorities. The support of 4 DSNs in the region of Global Trade and Entrepreneurship/Small Business will provide critical connections to business and industry.  A new regional effort spearheaded by the Los Angeles GTL DSN at Long Beach on a Digital Badging project will codify student skill development and industry. Flexible Internship Training program (FIT)+ E-Portfolios will be developed for students/workers. ","The majority of employers surveyed in Los Angeles County reported challenges finding qualified employees in all six occupations. When employers in Los Angeles and Orange County were asked if they believed there was a lack of qualified workers entering the industry, 59% of them said yes.  Of that percentage, more than two-thirds of employers thought of it as a slight concern and more than a quarter of them believed it was a great concern.  
More than half of employers surveyed stated that there is a lack of qualified employees entering the GTL sector. This represents an opportunity for the community colleges to train more students for high-demand occupations in GTL.  Wages are appealing for entry-level workers, and show significant increases as workers gain more education and experience.
 Southern California is projected to add about 350,000 jobs in the Logistics Industry by 2030.  Over the next three years, employment for supply chain-related occupations is expected to grow by 12,900 jobs. Employers across a variety of industries posted over 50,000 online job advertisements for twelve supply chain occupations in 2012.  Data from our Los Angeles/Orange County region indicates the two occupations with the highest number of employees are Customer Service Representatives (174), and Logistics Specialists/Coordinators (172), followed by International Sales Representatives/Associates (109)and Global Sourcing or Procurement Specialists/Coordinators (108). Although employers in both counties are expecting to increase their number of workers, companies in Los Angeles are expected to grow at a much faster pace and add a higher number of jobs. 
Students considering GTL as a profession do not view it as exciting and diverse in opportunity because its image is one of ports, trucking, and warehouses.  In reality it is so much more, with tremendous opportunities in E-Commerce & Cybersecurity, Supply Chain, International Trade, Customs & Regulations, Air Cargo and Air Delivery.  Each of these fields is utilizing the latest technologies and has global reach with all businesses in some form. The need promises continued growth over the next 10-20 years.
","In this first year we will begin to meet the needs of the labor market through education/training, job readiness training, internship placements, job shadowing opportunities, and job placement opportunities with committed industry partnerships that have been established and that will increase with the addition of four new college partners. 

 Last year’s college partners provided education program offerings in these certificate and degree programs related to global trade and entrepreneurship:

With this foundational preparation, students will also need work readiness preparation.  We are planning job readiness training priorities that will focus on Career Choices, Career Search, Career Profile, Career Resources, Career Confidence, Career Networking and Career Preparation.  

Our Digital Badge Eco-System “NEXUS EDGE” project in partnership with LinkedIn and the LinkedIn Learning platform will implement an online eco-system that introduces college to career exploration in 8th grade, support introduction of global competencies and work readiness activities in 9th-11th grades, and provide a project based digital badge program in 12th grade, plus online peer-to-peer mentoring in 12th grade. We will implement a college level advanced project based digital badge program + industry mentoring, access to a GTL job board. Data will be captured through various digital touch-points throughout the eco-system to assist in comprehensive data capture related to GTL and student exposure to GTL pathways.   In addition, there are 2 types of digital badge projects aligned with industry recognized credentials ( CGBP - certified global business professional) of NASBITE and CSCMP) (certified supply chain management professional of CSCMP).



","Last year with CTE-EF funding, PRO-GTL, the Global Trade & Logistics Regional Consortia of 7 colleges accomplished some impressive results that included:
3,291 enrollments 
35 certificate programs
178 completers
28 degrees
20 industry credentials
40 work-based learning experiences
In addition, 400 participants including 130 students and 16 industry partners participated in our sold out Global Trade & Logistics Regional Summit held in Long Beach.  Also our first-year CoffeeHouse Industry Series attracted professional speakers from small business/corporations, e-commerce, supply chain, banking/finance, and global trade, was conducted at 5 campuses with an attendance of 402 students.
We have provided students with career exploration and preparation with curriculum, credentials, and work-based learning experiences.  
This year with 10 colleges we anticipate exceeding the previous outcomes and engaging industry in providing internships and job opportunities for prepared students.  The digital badging component of this project will validate the learning experiences students have achieved and better prepare them for entry into GTL careers.     
","The Los Angeles Economic Development Corporation (LAEDC) determined that projected top growth from 2015-2020 in LA County in Service Providing Industries would be found in Wholesale Trade, Retail Trade, Transportation, Warehousing, Utilities, and Professional and Business Services – each incorporated in global trade and logistics operations.  They identified global trade and logistics as a target for specific economic and workforce development interventions.    This is supported by their data that approximately 55 percent of all employment in Los Angeles County is in local industry clusters and almost 32 percent is in traded industry clusters, such as trade, entertainment, business services and fashion. The largest traded industry cluster in Los Angeles County in 2014 was trade, employing approximately 270,400 workers, followed by business services, with just over 235,700 workers.  Clearly, job opportunities exist in our region to be filled in the coming years.

The Center of Excellence in their most recent report on Global Trade for LA and OC Counties (Nov. 2014) listed the most in-demand occupations in the region.  They included:  
-Logistics Specialists/Coordinators 
-Regulatory/ Compliance Specialists 
-Global Sourcing or Procurement Specialists/Coordinators 
-Customer Service Representatives 
-International Sales Representatives/Associates 
-International Marketing Coordinators
Key findings obtained from this study indicated that new employment opportunities can be filled by community college graduates for these six occupations studied.

An online employer survey was conducted with more than 200 employers in the region about the six occupations selected for study.  This report presents findings from the survey about regional employers’ profiles, occupational data, job growth, wages, and job requirements. Skill gaps are also identified that community colleges could potentially address by offering new courses and/or adapting current programs to meet the current and projected needs of employers. In the next five years, employers in Los Angeles and Orange Counties are expecting to add more Customer Service Representatives than any other occupation. Since companies are seeing a spike in their sales, more of these professionals will be needed to resolve clients’ inquiries, requests, and problems.  This need can be met through our certificate training programs.

"This project is designed to provide a regionally coordinated career pathway approach to curriculum and program development in the health sector, a sector that has been identified by LAEDC and the LA Area Chamber of Commerce as one of top priority sectors for the region as it relates to demand. The specific programs selected are vetted by industry as high demand occupations with current and projected openings and will serve both students and job seekers. Additional jobs or occupations will be added based on health sector industry and employer input and industry engagement.  The project addresses a range of workforce needs along the career pathway continuum, which ranges from career pathway exploration and preparation for entry level positions to post-degree training for RNs to meet workforce shortages. The project will include full program development, career pathway development (K- 16), curriculum development and alignment, work-based learning, employer engagement, outreach and recruitment, equipment and professional development.   This includes finalizing innovations in core/foundation curriculum/certification, the alignment, enhancement and/or development of health occupations specifically in Respiratory Therapy and Radiologic Tech/Sonography (others can be added based on industry partner needs), and curriculum development for a number of Specialty RN jobs, programs that can be implemented in college, mid-level career training and post-licensure specialization.","This project addresses a range of workforce needs along the health care sector career pathway continuum, which ranges from preparation for entry level positions to post-degree training for RNs to meet workforce shortages. The project will include alignment, enhancement and development of foundational curriculum, curriculum and program enhancement in Respiratory Therapy and Radiologic Tech/Sonography, and curriculum development for a number of Specialty RN jobs, programs that can be implemented in college or articulated high school programs, mid-level career training and post-licensure specialization.

The Foundational Curriculum program expands on the work of the Los Angeles Healthcare Competencies to Careers Consortium (LAH3C) to the LA/OC region. The project was funded by the Department of Labor and included all nine LACCD colleges. Program funding ends in April 2017 and the Strong Workforce Program could provide funds to regionalize the project outcomes including the Health Occupations courses, which comprise the Healthcare Foundation Certificate, part of a number of industry-informed stackable credentials developed as part of LAH3C. The project also featured digital badges (micro-credentialing), work-based learning, work readiness certification for the healthcare industry, and sustained industry engagement supported by the DSN. Regional Curriculum alignment and a regional industry advisory would greatly benefit the workforce.
","At the request of industry, the colleges have been asked to explore expanding the region's participation in one of two consortia projects which will consist of program development, curriculum alignment with industry needs, career pathway development, K-16 pathway development, new curriculum development (as needed), work-based learning, employer engagement, outreach and recruitment, equipment acquisition and upgrades, and professional development. The consortia will be charged with updating and replicating Respiratory Therapy and Radiology Technician/Sonography curriculum (LA City College and East Los Angeles College)

The California Hospital Association (CHA) and Hospital Association of Southern California (HASC) have identified the shortage of specialty Registered Nurses as a priority workforce need. A workgroup was formed to analyze the problem. The workgroup determined a shortage of specialty nurses does exist and prioritized seven areas, with hiring projections over the next year as follows: Critical Care: 2,320; Emergency: 1,392; Perioperative: 1,072; Labor & Delivery: 864; Neonatal ICU: 688; Case Manager, Care Coordinator and Mental Health: growing. The Health DSN LA partnered with HASC to collect additional data (attached) which validates the need for specialty RNs in the region. One of the recommendations is to prepare new and existing nurses via an RN transition program for specialty roles, whereby licensed nurses are enrolled in these specialty courses in a college nursing program. Curriculum includes clinical and didactic components. Colleges will provide lead clinical faculty and program coordination, working with one or more hospitals, which provide preceptors. The RN Transition Program model was launched in 2010, and has since been replicated in approximately 20 locations across California. Many regional community colleges currently offer transition programs for new graduates entering practice. The RN specialty curriculum can be paired with a transition clinical course to help meet the industry need. This project will develop curriculum for several of the high demand RN specialties and offer the courses strategically across the region to meet the industry need.

This project proposes to create a pathway from entry level health occupations to high demand high paying specialty RN careers. In the August 2016 COE Report – “Top 100 Occupations in Los Angeles County” 2 of the top 3 jobs were in the health sector with Registered Nurse (RN) in the top spot. Respiratory Therapists, Radiologic Technologists, and Diagnostic Medical Sonographers are also included in this “Top 10”. 
","The goal of this proposal is to provide a pathway of educational opportunities, designed around industry identified competencies and needs, to allow the learner to progress from entry level in demand occupations to higher paying and high demand occupations in the health sector. 
The health sector is identified as a high priority sector by all 7 regional WDBs as well as by the LAEDC. The specific occupations identified for focus in this project are based on ongoing conversations including those facilitated through the LA Area Chamber of Commerce Health Collaborative and other interested groups. 
The Health Sector Career Pathway Project is open to adding additional strategies and activities to meet industry needs not yet identified by the partners.

"SMC is offering one of 15 high quality, affordable, and in demand bachelor degrees in the California Community College system. The bachelor degree in Interaction Design (also referred to as IxD and User Experience Design) provides important and accessible opportunities for students to continue their education and advance in their careers in the high-demand ICT sector. User Experience is fundamentally about the relationship between people and technology. It’s about identifying and designing for that relationship. As the amount of technology and digital disruption in the world increases, such as with Wearables and the Internet of Things (IoT) this disruption will increase. The social Web has already disrupted marketing to an incredible degree. What used to be primarily a discipline in managing returns on broadcast media expenditure has evolved to become a discipline of managing conversations and contributing to global communities. The interdisciplinary nature of these occupations requires traditional departments and disciplines to work together to best prepare students with evolving skills needed across occupations such as software development, gaming, virtual reality, design and digital marketing that have become a booming sector in Los Angeles. This consortia will bring together faculty across these disciplines and across area colleges with relevant programming. 

SMC will partner with PCC and GCC to develop programming that aligns with SMC’s AS degree to prepare students to enter SMC BS degree in junior standing (completions of 60 units) from their Graphic Design, Computer Science, Game design program (or related field).  Further, the new program development in Digital Marketing (Facebook) will align with the IxD degree. This IxD consortia seeks to focus on human capital development that is needed in Los Angeles and create meaningful partnerships that unify the educational, business and community stakeholders in support of preparing students for employment in digital workforce.
","The pathways approach is valuable to students because many have not been exposed to the career opportunities that are available—particularly pathways leading to high-wage, high-skill digital workforce occupations in the Information, Communications, Technology (ICT) field. Yet pathways require comprehensive attention and investments if colleges are to achieve successful workforce outcomes. Employers also demand a regional approach. ","This Consortia will maximize sustained industry engagement, strengthen career pathways and programs of study, and expand opportunities for work-based learning (paid and unpaid internships, job shadowing, and mentoring and job placement). New and seasoned Career Technical Education (CTE) faculty requires professional development and externships in order to address the needs of business and industry in identified priority and emerging sectors. Finally, the consortia will invest in regional marketing, curriculum alignment, streamlined regional processes as well as labor market data collection and analysis for data-informed decision making.","The project will decimate ICT labor market trends across three campuses, build career pathways across numerous ICT occupations, determine specializations and the interconnectivity of disciplines, inform faculty of changing job requirements, validate skill competencies, create work-based learning for students, promote joint investment in and sharing of resources, and outreach to employers and students.

The institute will focus on improving our Business and Finance industry sector with an emphasis on entrepreneurship and strengthening collaborations between business, industry and community colleges to support the growth of startups, and existing businesses in the region.","The iCAPs Professional Development Academy will convene industry experts, aspiring entrepreneurs, college leaders, including faculty and counselors to engage in discourse that will support and guide curriculum design at our colleges.  The institute will focus on reviewing and updating current programs, while identify small business challenges to inform curriculum design and ensure new program development is responsive to the needs of small businesses in the region.   The iCAPs project will develop a targeted approach that will help small businesses learn how to build capacity, access capital, and integrate business and education.     In this manner, iCAPs 2.0 will enhance entrepreneurship teaching strategies, stimulate small business development and support the growth of the Los Angeles regions’ entrepreneurship ecosystem.    ","Stimulating the development of small businesses is critical to the success and growth of the Los Angeles region and its economy.  According to the National Small Business Association 2014 Year-End Report, small businesses are the number one contributor to job creation in the Los Angeles region.  Between 2013 and 2014 63% of jobs in the region were created by small businesses.  Another, key data piece about the small business/entrepreneurship ecosystem, is that only 45% of small business were able to grow and expand their revenue in 2014.  Revenue growth can limit and impact a business ability to fuel job creation.  The Los Angeles and Orange County regional consortia has identified small business as one of the 8 priority and emerging sectors.  Regional projects aimed at improving one of the 8 industry sectors are prioritized to ensure we improve our regional economy.  ","The iCAPs project will address the need to strengthen and expand small business, increase job creation and fuel economic growth in our region.  Los Angeles City College iCAPs 2.0 will aim to achieve the following four overarching goals: 
1.	Develop, enhance and update curriculum in business management and education with a focus on entrepreneurship and small business development
2.	Deliver technical assistance and support for small businesses to learn how to integrate business management techniques into business operations
3.	Establish a small learning community for small business owners to share business needs and challenges 
4.	Provide targeted business training in the areas of; business planning, financing options to expand business, financial projections, how to access capital, branding and marketing connect business with partners/colleges/advisory groups.
","Regional Priorities Addressed:
1. Maximizing sustained industry engagement; 
2. Strengthening career pathways and programs of study; 
4. Attending to the need for new CTE faculty recruitment and professional development and externships for current faculty; and  
5. Addressing the needs of business and industry in identified priority and emerging sectors.

"Instruction in writing software for mobile platforms such as Android, IOS, and Windows requires a robust computer system to support resource intensive tools and emulators. This proposal creates a Virtual Machine (VM) that can be deployed on the BACCC regional Netlab+ infrastructure enabling participating colleges to provide instruction in mobile software development on Android, IOS, and Windows, without purchasing developer quality local hardware and maintaining a complex software stack.

Many entrepreneurs start their small business by writing an Application (App) for sale through App stores managed by  Apple, Google( Android), or Microsoft. These app stores provide marketing and promotional services that enable the small business owner to sell their app without setting up their own e-commerce platform and site. This proposal enables software developers to learn how to write mobile applications and presents a strong Community College alternative to boot camps that charge exorbitant fees for instruction. ","The dominance of smart phones and smart mobile devices has created high demand for applications. However there continues to be an under-supply of professionals with the training to develop software that targets mobile platforms. The dominant platforms of Android, iOs (Apple), and Windows each have their own stack of Software Development Kits (SDKs), Compilers, and emulators - software versions of mobile hardware. In offer to offer instruction in mobile software development a Community College must first invest in a laboratory of robust developer quality machines, install several complex suites of development, software, and maintain this stack as changes are made to each platform and ecosystem.

This proposal addresses the need for each college to purchase install and maintain mobile development systems by creating a Virtual Machine (VM) that can be hosted on the BACCC regional Netlab+ infrastructure. This proposal would produce the outcome of permitting mobile software development to be taught using a browser that provides access to a pre-configured centrally maintained suite of mobile software development tools. 



","A common set of tools and practices for mobile software development cultivates regional workforce development and provides consistency in Knowledge Units (KU). This consistency simplifies job descriptions and the assessment of Knowledge, Skills and Abilities (KSA) used to evaluate candidates.

Leveraging in-place infrastructure while  extending it to new platforms uses familiarity to flatten the learning curve. A workforce where members are experienced with the same set of tools promotes an effective way to shorten the start-up phase of software development teams. 

Individual software development entrepreneurs can find a pool of potential collaborators and have confidence in their ability to come up-to-speed quickly. This commonality leads to a robust ecosystem where the workforce can adjust to local needs while developing transferable skills region wide.

We will work with the California STEM/Core Network http://growthsector.org/programs/stem-core/ which focuses specifically on Computer Science to align internships and permanent placement opportunities for students. Soft-skill training and workplace readiness will leverage the CTE center at Merritt college to benefit regional employers and workforce job candidates.

","This proposal provides a strong up-to date context and market that supplements the existing Computer Science degree, transfer, and certificate models. Mobile Software spans most of the Information Communication Technology/Digital Media (ICT/DM) sectors  which maps to strong workforce opportunities for workers with these skills.

This proposal addresses the needs by reducing the cost of instruction and providing ready-made workstation that can be embedded in many different mobile software instruction programs. By providing faculty with a mobile software development workstation that works ""right-out-of-the-box"", they can focus on the developing specific curriculum needed by their students and program. Students don't have to purchase expensive computers because the software development VMs are available around the clock on a reservation basis. Colleges do not have to purchase, maintain, update, and manage systems and credentials because BACCC already has these solutions in place. The participating community colleges are already familiar with the VM reservation procedures and policies. Support for students and faculty are already met locally by Netlab+ ""Community Managers"" at each college. This re-use of in-place support enables this program to be rolled out with minimal training needs.

","The ICT/DM prioritizes Career and Technical Education (CTE) that results in local employment opportunity. This proposal provides Community Colleges the opportunity to develop and/or improve outcomes for students which include:

1) Entry Level Employment through The A.S. Computer Science pathway.
2) Occupational Certificate in Mobile Software Development.
3) Skills upgrade for software development professions through mobile focused courses.

By leveraging existing infrastructure and aligning programs regionally we can deliver high quality instruction at a low cost per capita while having negligible impact on the capital and expense budgets of community colleges. "

"In partnership with the east, west, and south Sonoma County high schools (6 total), all part of the ""Jump Start Program to Santa Rosa Jr. College,"" this proposal has two main goals.  The first goal of this project is to finish equiping the SRJC Petaluma Recording Studio so that students will have access to completing the Digital Media: Audio Certificate on the Petaluma Campus, by taking Music 60A (Audio Recording 1) and 60B (Audio Recording 2).  Currently Petaluma Campus offers more than half of the Digital Media: Audio Certificate courses (i.e. CS 74.11, MUSC 50, MUSC 51A, MUSC 51B, and MUSC 1).  Petaluma Academic Affairs is committed to offering the remaining courses (MUSC 60A, MUSC 60B, and CS 50.32) in a 2 year rotation that offers semester/time/day scheduling diversity from when the classes are offering on the Santa Rosa Campus. 
The second goal is to build a bridge between the local high school digital media programs and SRJC Petaluma.  SRJC’s Petaluma’s Jump Start team has established strong partnerships with 6 local high schools, several of which have CTE pathways for digital media: Casa Grande High School, Petaluma High School, Sonoma Valley High School, Tomalas High School, Tech High School and Rancho Cotati High School.  Jump Start is an outreach and early matriculation program for high school seniors that begins with planning meetings and involves outreach visits to high schools in Fall semester.  Placement testing and orientation occurs during Spring semester at SRJC Petaluma.  The high school students will be transported to SRJC Petaluma to participate in CTE film and audio production lab classes, where they will be paired up with college students to work on projects and attend the Media 10 Cinema Series class.  Many of these students will likely return in April for the Student Film Festival that is hosted by SRJC Petaluma.  Participating students will also be invited to join in the production workshops held at the Film Fest Petaluma in May, where high profile filmmakers teach workshops on their crafts.  We expect that these visits to our Digital Media classes will better inform these students of the CTE Digital Media offerings and increase their enrollment in our CTE classes.","This proposal would address the student demand for Digital Media: Audio classes that the District is currently not meeting.  In addition, it would add to SRJC’s Petaluma’s list of Certificates that can be completed on this campus.  The District could offer the same classes during different semesters and at different days/times, helping students who miss a semester complete faster by not having to wait a year before the class is offered again.  The effectiveness of this proposal could easily be measured by enrollments and completers of the certificate.  ","The Digital Media: Audio program is well aligned with industry standards.  We offer state of the art computers and outstanding faculty in this discipline.  These simple additions to the Petaluma studio will bring the Petaluma Campus Digital Media: Audio program in full alignment with industry standards.

Cultivating an effective and attentive advisory board requires an active dialogue with local, statewide, national, and global partners.  Industry advisors come from a variety of stakeholder groups: individuals employed in industry specific disciplines, Chamber of Commerce members, BACCC colleagues, DSNs, discipline faculty, K-12 partners, university partners, current and former students, and college administrators.  

Program Coordination and Personnel Support
Program coordination and personnel support will facilitate the accomplishment of SWP grant objectives.  This support consists of release time for faculty program coordinators, a workforce development director, student assistants and a program services coordinator.

Facilities, Equipment & Software
In order to expand CTE programs and increase student access, faculty leaders and administrators will upgrade facilities, equipment and software.  The business/entrepreneurship hub will invest in simulcasting technology and an improved layout for greater student engagement. This category of investment will benefit all CTE programs.

Program Marketing:
Cañada College offers an exciting array of robust and relevant career and technical education programs, including Accounting, Business, Computer Business Office Technology, Digital Art and Animation, Early Childhood Education & Child Development, Fashion Design and Merchandising, Interior Design, Paralegal, Human Services, and Medical Assisting.  To complement these programs, as part of the Strong Workforce Program, the college is developing new CTE programs in Neurodiagnostic Technology and Information Currency & Digital Currency. An additional college undertaking is to revitalize the college’s Small Business and Entrepreneurship program by upgrading and enhancing its “Business Hub” lab space and by working with the College of San Mateo’s Small Business Development Center. Business & Entrepreneurship Club students plan to launch a new student run business on campus during the 2017 calendar year.

To inform campus and community stakeholders about the division’s career and technical education offerings, the Business, Design and Workforce division will develop and implement an integrated marketing campaign that consists of branded marketing brochures, web pages, social media communication, blogs and more. This essential outreach effort will reinforce the Cañada College slogan “From here, you can go anywhere.”  Clear, effective marketing collateral and consistent marketing efforts will benefit students and community and industry partners in many ways.  Frequently, high school, adult school, re-entry and JobTrain students may not be familiar with the available CTE pathways they can pursue.  By meeting students where they are and thoughtfully detailing the options, they can select, the college will enable a larger number of students to achieve certificate, degree and career success.

Curriculum Development:
Cañada College offers an exciting array of robust and relevant career and technical education programs including Accounting, Business, Computer Business Office Technology, Digital Art and Animation, Early Childhood Education & Child Development, Fashion Design and Merchandising, Interior Design, Paralegal, Human Services, and Medical Assisting.  
Career and technical education faculty members require state of the art knowledge and expertise to grow and expand curriculum and to respond to the demand for new and more current certificates and degrees.  With an increasingly technologically capable student demographic, faculty must continue to upgrade their knowledge of software and instructional delivery modalities.  Since the state of California mandates that CTE faculty update and revise their curriculum every two years, faculty who manage these programs must engage in the rigorous process of learning new software, revising student learning outcome assessments, updating textbooks and meeting with industry and academic partners.  Curricular updates and revisions require extensive knowledge and time and are critical for maintaining current and relevant certificates and degrees.

Certificate and Degree Completion: 
Cañada College offers a dynamic array of robust and relevant career and technical education programs, including Accounting, Business, Computer Business Office Technology, Digital Art and Animation, Early Childhood Education & Child Development, Fashion Design and Merchandising, Interior Design, Paralegal, Human Services, and Medical Assisting.  

In response to labor market demand, industry advisory board input, and engagement with partners serving under-served sectors, faculty leaders in CTE programs continue to design new courses, certificates and degrees. Within these parameters, there some semesters when the college needs to offer newly developed or lower enrolled courses so students are able to complete certificates and degrees that are essential for their advancement in their desired career pathways.  In these situations, SWP support for these courses, certificates and degrees facilitates the attainment of more and better CTE programs for students.","This proposal addresses the overall need to increase CTE faculty capacity and professional industry knowledge, as well as increasing the number of qualified CTE faculty,  while providing resources to assist in the recruitment of students into CTE programs at Cañada College. The overall goal of this proposal is to increase student enrollments and success by providing up-to-date courses and programs informed by local and regional employers.","This proposal meets the needs of the Bay Area labor market by ensuring that faculty receive ongoing professional development paired with opportunities to develop robust advisory boards for CTE programs (supported in local share funding) to truly prepare students with the skills needed by local and regional employers. By working with employers to inform the development of new and existing programs, employers will be more eager to hire our students. ","This proposals meets the identified needs by supporting various on-and-off campus professional development opportunities for faculty, addressing CTE equipment and software needs across all programs, supporting streamlined, integrated marketing campaigns to increase the number of enrollments and completions, and offering of experiential courses to support new program and certificate creation. ","In accordance with the Strong Workforce Taskforce Recommendations, the BACCC supports the development of robust career pathways. As such, this proposal intends to enhance and develop pathways at Cañada College. "

"Cañada College will establish a viticulture and enology program to educate students in the art and science of growing grapes, fermentation sciences, and vineyard management. With Cañada's fertile soil, open acreage, mild climate and close proximity to multiple wineries, the College is well situated to initiate this certificate/degree program.  The College plans to partner with local industry advisors for guidance and potential internship/job opportunities for students.
Employment opportunities for students who graduate with a Certificate in Winemaking include vineyard cellar employees, fermentation lab technicians, and retail sales representatives. Students will also have the opportunity to pursue a Certificate in Vineyard Management. These students will be able to pursue jobs as vineyard growers, assistants and managers.
","The Bay Area is experiencing an employee supply gap for viticulture related jobs. There are currently no viticulture programs at community colleges in San Mateo County, thus there is no local pipeline of interns and employees to fill this need. Further, the COE projects that 53.5% of farmers, ranchers and other agricultural managers are self-employed, which clearly paints a need to incorporate entrepreneurship and small business education into this program. ","The Bay Area has a plethora of large and small scale wineries and tasting rooms throughout the region. Students in this industry generally obtain well paying jobs as growers, assistants, managers or go on to start their own ventures as self-employed individuals creating jobs for others. A current supply gap of qualified employees in this field exists in the Bay Area and this proposal intends to fill this gap by working with local and regional employers to secure quality internships and job opportunities for our students that lead to high wage jobs. ","This proposal intends to establish a viticulture, enology and wine business program at Cañada to meet the needs of local employers in the viticulture and wine business fields. In addition, Cañada has a robust small business program which will work to incorporate contextualized courses into this program to ensure that students possess the skill sets necessary to be successful as an employee or employer after obtaining a degree or certificate.","In accordance with the Strong Workforce Taskforce Recommendations, the BACCC supports the development of robust career pathways. As such, this proposal intends to develop a robust viticulture, enology and wine business pathway at Cañada College to meet regional employer needs. "
"San Mateo County, even more than the rest of the state, lacks qualified and credentialed teachers.  According to the California Department of Education (2016), 7000 more credentialed teachers are needed to even meet the current shortage in K-12 education throughout the state.
To become K-12 teachers, individuals must earn a bachelors degree and complete a fifth year of post-baccalaureate study.  Students in community colleges often encounter difficulties transferring to and graduating from four-year institutions. The tests to enter (CBEST and CSET) also present obstacles.  Current ECE teachers, often working adults, face challenges including increasing requirements from the Quality Rating System, Head Start, a lack of general education, and extended remediation pathways that prevent them from moving into a “Teacher Credential Preparation Pathway.”
In response to these challenges, Cañada College has developed a plan to support students wishing to to become early childhood educators, multiple and single subject credentialed teachers.  The program goal is to provide students with a clear, articulated pathway from a bachelor’s to a credential program at Cañada College.  Cañada College will work with university partners to establish the following two programs:
The PATH Program with San Francisco State’s BA program focuses on quality adult/child interaction, special education and reflective practices.  Courses in this program will be offered at Cañada’s campus. The program targets current ECE/CD students.  At the end of this degree, students will be prepared to enter the ECE workforce in San Mateo County.
The Notre Dame De Namur (NDNU) Liberal Studies BA and NDNU Credential Programs address the next steps in higher education for teachers pursuing BA and credentials. The courses will be offered at convenient times at Cañada, the SM County Office of Education, and NDNU.  There will be guaranteed course work, case management and embedded tutoring.","There are not enough qualified, degreed or credentialed teachers to support students and children in San Mateo County. The CDE estimates that approximately 7000 more credentialed K-12 teachers are needed to fill the supply gap in California alone. Further, ECE teachers, which don't necessarily require a credential and historically haven't needed a BA degree, are facing increased standards which require them to go back to school to attain a BA degree. 

","This proposal meets regional labor market needs by addressing a supply gap for the number of credentialed K-12 teachers throughout California, and by addressing a skills gap due to increasing standards for teaching within early childhood education. As a result of this proposal, the region will be poised to fill needed K-12 teaching positions and have a pool of qualified ECE teachers ready to enter the workforce. ","This proposal addresses the need to offer clear educational pathways for students that wish to be ECE educators, or those that wish earn their teaching credential to become multiple or single subject K-12 educators. In order to meet identified needs, ECE educators need discipline specific training to improve quality in the classroom (BA Degree Attainment) and K-12 teachers need to be in the pipeline to be trained as a credential teacher (Post – BA Credential). Through partnerships with both San Francisco State University and Notre Dame de Namur, students can take courses to achieve a BA or teaching credential at Cañada's campus, the San Mateo County Office of Education or NDNU's campus. ","In accordance with the Strong Workforce Taskforce Recommendations, the BACCC supports the development of robust career pathways. As such, this proposal intends to enhance and develop ECE and Educational Aide pathways at Cañada College. "
"This project will prototype dedicated CTE and Workforce research infrastructure in Contra Costa to support Strong Workforce and other workforce/CTE initiatives through analysis, cross-college workforce data projects and professional development. ","As colleges integrate workforce development into the overall fabric of their mission, they will require enhanced capacity for using data and research to support alignment, integration of initiatives and effectiveness.  At present, existing research capacity within Contra Costa tends to prioritize other aspects of institutional effectiveness, and support workforce-related research in a one-off fashion. To truly continuously improve and integrate the various workforce and CTE initiatives, dedicated research support for this work is required. 
","This proposal will help colleges align program review and other institutional effectiveness research issues with the Strong Workforce Program, and inform data driven program improvement. The goal will be to increase enrollment and completion rates, by more thoroughly understanding existing patterns and addressing gaps. ","By creating dedicated workforce research capacity, Contra Costa will be able to more systematically and consistently support analysis of workforce programs, share progress on SWP, Equity, SSSP, AEBG, and other core indicators for use by colleges, and support cross-college workforce data projects.  In addition, this researcher would be tasked with helping build up capacity with local college faculty and administrators on statewide data tools, through professional development.  ","Data is a key element for informing better workforce and CTE programs. Developing integrated data analysis, and consistent resources to inform program improvement, student supports, etc. is a regional priority. "

"Regional occupational councils, sector partnerships and business/industry leadership teams are an important asset for regions to understand employer demand and industry shifts. However, for colleges to engage effectively with these industry forums, local capacity is needed to help translate employer interests/requirements into action at the colleges. This project focuses on building internal capacity to liaise to and enhance industry connections, including expanded work-based learning (WBL), revised curriculum, jobs for students, new programs, identification of new faculty and other local transactional needs, through staff and technology resources.  It also reinforces existing East Bay Regional Industry Partnerships, to prototype ways to more effectively engage with exisiting employer tables. This project will complement broader regional work led by the DSN's, and will be in partnership with workforce Boards, economic development agencies, and other regional partners.","While DSN's, sector partnerships and regional marketplace projects address high-level curriculum and occupational demand issues, there exists a strong need for direct, local, transactional support between colleges and employers to convert regional dialogue into concrete outcomes for students and our colleges. These potential outcomes could include expanded WBL, enhanced curriculum and programs, access to new faculty, increased placement, and more local on-demand training.  ","This project will increase local alignment of supply and demand between education and industry, and enable colleges to more effectively integrate program/curricular input, capitalize on WBL, apprenticeship and job offerings for students, and partner more concretely with industry (especially employers participating in sector partnerships, councils, etc). ","By hiring dedicated staff to support district and college industry engagement this project supports more concrete outcomes within colleges around WBL, curriculum, jobs, etc. This project also reinforces use of regionally developed technology tools to facilitate transactions with industry, as well bolsters existing regional industry sector partnerships to be sure robust forums for employer engagement exist. ","Industry engagement strategies is one of the highest priority strategies in the Bay Region."

"For the first SWP allocation, College CEOs and the CRC Steering Committee have prioritized a Regional Marketing and Outreach project for the majority of the 10% set-aside.  The project will develop a multi-media, multi-pronged approach to marketing CTE programs regionally and will leverage regional efforts with statewide “projects in common” efforts related to branding and outreach to students and to employers. The statewide branding and outreach effort is already underway. The regional consortium will convene a marketing committee with regional representation to develop a Request-for-Proposal. Depending on the scope of the campaign, it might be divided into phases. In regards to the CCCCO, they will be investing $3M if the regions statewide can match $3M toward a CTE Rebranding effort. The region’s match would go toward customizing the outreach: 1) specific to the region’s sectors and employer partners/voices; and, 2) specific to the ground-game needed in each region to get in front of underserved students/families so they better understand their higher education options. The CCCCO has retained the services of renowned Public Relations firm Ogilvy to do an environmental scan and set a path forward on how the $3M of state funds will be deployed. The CCCCO feels it is important to keep consistency in the look and feel for how an outreach campaign is deployed lest we undermine its effectiveness and continue to confuse employers/students. It is anticipated the RFP will be issued in late 2017. The successful contractor will be expected to coordinate with the CCCCO’s re branding efforts, as well as with individual CTE marketing efforts at CRC districts and colleges.","CTE's share of statewide community college enrollment (FTES) declined from 31.3% in 2000/2001 to 28.2% in 2013/2014. While non-CTE FTES increased 16.2% during this time period, CTE FTES remained about the same. Overall, in years when total FTES increases, the percentage increase for CTE tends to be lower than for non-CTE. In years when total FTES decreased, the percentage decrease in CTE tends to be greater than for non-CTE. This pattern has been observed in the Central/Mother Lode region as well as statewide. The colleges in the Central/Mother Lode region seek to increase enrollments in their CTE programs. A coherent message of CTE programs leading to careers across the region is desired. The State Chancellor's office has retained the services of renowned public relations firm Ogilvie to do an environmental scan and set a path forward on to deploy up to $3 million of state funds. This project aims to ensure that the Central/Mother Lode regional plan is to be coordinated with that plan. In addition, the public workforce system engages employers by program, with different people from different organizations calling employers to hire their participants. Each college does its own marketing of its career technical education programs to employers; there is no cohesive, coherent message to all employers in the region. ","CTE enrollments have been in decline throughout the region over the past decade. However, the gap between job openings and the availability of qualified applicants is expected to increase to over one million jobs statewide by 2025. The number of students enrolling in CTE programs in the region and statewide is not expected to fill that gap. Strong Workforce Program local funds will provide additional CTE training opportunities, but students must learn that they are available and that they offer the ability to earn a living wage. In addition, regional partners identified several cross-sector employer needs/priorities by utilizing the findings from multiple sector studies. The top priority is for workers with strong soft skills – communication, professionalism, critical thinking, problem solving, etc. These soft skills make the difference in securing and retaining employment; previous work experience also is key for many well-paying middle-skill occupations, and employers across sectors report the need for more experienced workforce. Regional employers have difficulties finding qualified employees and are interested in new ways to find and cultivate new talent. They indicate that industry-based certifications are an indicator to employers of a job candidate’s technical proficiency. While some businesses surveyed (particularly in advanced manufacturing) indicated a strong interest in partnering with the community colleges for internships and company tours, many were not aware of the training programs that the community colleges offer or how they could partner with the colleges to find a qualified work force.","This proposal addresses the identified needs by hiring a marketing firm to develop a regional marketing plan focused on increasing both student and employer involvement in the community colleges, implementing that regional plan, and coordinating with local college and state marketing.","Marketing regional and local CTE programs is a high priority within the CRC; and identified in alignment with the regional strategic plan, as well as with the goals of the CRC strategic plan."

"The Strong Workforce investment will be allocated to a full time faculty position in Agribusiness, with an emphasis in food safety, who will create & maintain new pathways to completion.  These include industry recognized certificates, Associate of Science degrees and 2+ 2 baccalaureate degree partnerships with universities. ","The Ag Science industry is in need of more food safety experts who understand and can implement the mandates of the Food Safety Modernization Act. Further, the data shows there is a need for students with associate of science degrees (food safety science, agribusiness, agricultural production, horticultural technician, small farm operation and management, sustainable crop management), and 2+2 degrees. Currently, for the Santa Cruz/Monterey region there is a demand of 214 qualified candidates, however, the supply of qualified candidates is only 24.  At this time, all food safety courses are taught by qualified practitioners from within the fresh fruit and vegetable industry. Private industry courses are cost prohibitive for our students and rarely locally available.","The proposal meets the need of our region’s labor market by addressing the current huge gap between supply and demand.  According to the data, ag science employment opportunities have increased to 214 in 2017 for our region.  However, there are only an estimated 24 qualified workers to apply for those positions.  Hartnell proposes we close the gap by providing several pathways to completion and ultimately employment, as well as certifications that meet regulatory requirements for people currently within the industry.   Hartnell's offerings will include Certifications, AS degrees and 2+2 degree partnerships.  ","The proposal addresses the identified needs by allocating funds towards hiring a dedicated agribusiness faculty with an emphasis in food safety focused on creating pathways from high school to employment in agriculture.
The proposed program will provide options for students to obtain increased living wages and greater employment by providing certifications, AS degree and 2+2 degree options.  The faculty member will also facilitate student success and retention, internship development and monitoring, and expansion of industry relationships leading to employment in the students’ field of study. 
The certifications are for students already employed in the industry as well as those seeking employment.  These certificates will address training required by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration’s Food Safety Modernization Act.  These certifications increase access for students who cannot afford the food safety certified training currently provided by third party providers.
The new AS degrees are for students seeking employment within the agricultural industry, but do not require a 4 year degree- they include food safety science, horticultural technician, small farm operation and management, sustainable crop management. 
Lastly, the program includes development and implementation of a 2+2 Food Safety Management degree, a 2+2 Agribusiness Degree, and a 2+2 Crop & Soil Sciences degree.   
Additionally, the agribusiness program has traditionally been available in the evenings. A full time faculty member will allow for expansion of the course offerings to the mornings and afternoons.

Supplies & Equipment – These investments are specifically designed to support enhanced and applied applications for soil science, plant science, seed science, food safety science, food microbiology, and water quality related courses. Hands-on activities with the equipment and technologies utilized by industry will increase students' ag tech skills as well as their confidence and ability to apply what they have learned in a job environment.

"These funds will be used to hire an Advanced Automotive Technology Faculty instructor and an Automotive Non-Instructional Associate.  The program has reached capacity and without these two positions, Hartnell will be unable to effectively address the region's demand for trained technicians. The automotive service and repair industry has gone through tremendous changes in the last decade.  This faculty member will bring a deeper understanding of the technology that goes into the modern, more sophisticated automobile.  The faculty member will develop and implement curriculum for new certifications required by the industry employers. New certifications will include, but not be limited to, Automotive Clean Air and Emissions (which is a critical part of California's strategy for growing a robust green economy), Engine Performance, Electrical Systems and Brakes & Suspension.","The Hartnell Advanced Automotive program is currently at capacity and unable to meet the needs of this region to train students on automotive maintenance and repairs.  The industry would like to hire graduates with specialized skills demonstrated by certificates of achievement and/or completed AS degrees.  The current number of instructors and instructional associates prohibits any expansion of safe & effective program expansion.","Currently, as the data demonstrates, there is close to three times the demand for Automotive Service Technicians as there are available technicians to fill the positions in our region. The proposed positions will help us begin to close the gap on this demand by providing qualified candidates certified with specialized skills.  In addition, the full time Automotive Faculty member and Instructional Associate II will ensure students have access to training on clean air emissions within the Hartnell automotive program- this is paramount to meet the requirements of California's Clean Air Act.  With the addition of a full time automotive faculty member, we will be able to add additional classes in both the mornings and the afternoons to better meet the needs of our students.  The hiring of a non-instructional associate will allow us to support all classes, Monday-Saturday from 8:00am to 10:00pm.","Hartnell College will address the need by expanding the Advanced Automotive Program in terms of increasing the number & times of classes offered and growing our outreach to Monterey South County region.   We will provide better automotive curriculum for our students by growing our certifications in Engine Performance, Electrical Systems, Brakes and Suspension, and Clean Air Certification.  We will also strive to provide instruction in several locations within the Monterey South County area in addition to the primary location at the Hartnell Alisal Campus.  ","Strong Workforce legislation states that future funding will depend on: CTE FTES, job openings, and improvements in workforce metrics beyond the first year.  This project will address all three by increasing FTES through program modernization tied to stronger recruitment and increased number of completions, addressing job openings by producing higher skilled job-competitive program graduates, and preparing students/graduates to handle a broader set of responsibilities, leading to higher wages."

The current supply falls around 35 qualified candidates.  Hartnell seeks to close the supply/demand gap by providing educational and clinical experiences required for current and future emergency medical providers.","The EMT faculty member will develop, deliver, and evaluate academic and clinical classes based on educational theory, experiential teaching methodologies, and standards set by the National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians. The instructor will coordinate clinical rotation experiences and job placements within acute care hospitals, community-based associations, private agencies, and public service organizations. All accreditation reports, self-studies, and licensing verifications will be the responsibility of the new faculty member. This position will eradicate the inconsistent EMT student enrollment pattern evidenced in the 2009 to 2015 data that resulted from reliance of part-time faculty.  The EMT instructor will participate in the planning and implementation of the regional paramedic program initiative that includes Gavilan, Cabrillo, Monterey Peninsula, and Hartnell Colleges.","Enrollments will be restored to a minimum of 80 EMT students per academic year.  Restoration will be possible because of the hiring of the full-time EMT instructor. EMT certification classes developed by the full time faculty member will qualify students to become certified.  On completion of course requirements, students earn a Course Completion Cert, a requirement for EMT certification through the Ca. Emergency Med. Svcs Agency. EMT certification will result in immediate employment opportunities. Graduates can work as an EMT or apply the certification to more advanced positions such as safety officer, paramedic, fire fighter, and a variety of healthcare jobs.","This program addresses the priorities of both 'more' qualified students being employed in our region as well as increasing the current courses offered in Hartnell's current program.  The expansion of the program and the development of the only advanced certification and recertification courses in the area will improve access and employment/ job advancement opportunities for safety officers and first responders. Currently,  Monterey South County residents travel more than 75 miles to attend advanced and EMT recertification courses."

" Strong Workforce funding will support a full-time, licensed paramedic as a program director and primary instructor of the program. The director will also assist and coordinate with other EMS training needs. The incumbent will instruct approximately 100% of their load and be assigned to coordination duties as required. 

  "," The Health Care Industry is one of the fastest growing in the US. Pre-hospital care for our communities has a large gap between needed Paramedics and qualified individuals to fill those rolls. Local Ambulance companies and Regional EMS Agencies have encouraged Las Positas College  to create such a training program. Las Positas College has reviewed the National and California requirements to create and continue a Paramedic Program. The RFTC has developed the necessary curriculum, six courses totaling 36 units, and align with the California Chancellor’s office C-ID descriptors. These courses have been approved at both the local and state levels. This Director position request will provide coordination and instructional training for students & the Paramedic program, as well as provide additional support for the entire Las Positas College EMS Program. This request has been reviewed, approved and forwarded by our EMS Advisory Committee at the College.

instructors to obtain region-specific training needs. NATEF instructors are
required to obtain a minimum of 20 hours update training per year,
sometimes at substantial costs to their schools/colleges. Regional
instructors would have input as to content and scheduling of training
(often a point of contention for instructors seeking this training). Non-
NATEF automotive instructors would be eligible for the training as well.
This proposed training would provide the least amount of disruption to
instructor/participants classes at their colleges/high schools (i.e.,
instructors have input as to scheduling), would save regional
schools/colleges money (this training would require less travel and be
offered for non-profit), and the training would be relevant to this
regions’ needs (instructors have input as to content). Occupational

motivated about a career in C.T.E. Because the event is on campus, the
stronger the event and buy-in from high schools, the more enrollments the
college will realize as a result of the event. Funds will be used to
strengthen the competition to the levels of 5, 10, and 15 years ago. The
efforts to re-energize stakeholders will provide a return in terms of
articulation, high school-college relationships, and recent high school

"Recent changes in the healthcare arena, as well as in today’s technology-oriented healthcare students, require new teaching and learning methodologies, paradigms, and innovative curricula for the delivery of quality education. These changes are further exacerbated in many healthcare programs due to the average experienced educator age being 62.2 years old (AACN Faculty Shortage Sheet, 2017), contributing to the current 7.9% faculty position vacancy rate. For faculty that are recruited and hired to replace these experienced retiring faculty, the literature notes that lack of orientation and professional development are negatively associated with poor faculty retention rates. Further, the literature notes that most healthcare faculty today were not originally trained to be educators, but were instead trained as expert clinicians (Baker, 2010). This lack of qualified and well-prepared educators, who are not trained in the most current and relevant educational and healthcare advances and are not receiving the support they need to transition to their new roles, render it difficult to produce the best possible healthcare career graduates. It also makes it difficult for programs to continue to maintain and expand enrollments in these needed healthcare fields, through both increasing student numbers and in improvement of student retention and completion rates.  The proposed IEDRC Nursing and Allied Health Educator Bootcamp and Support Program will target 31 new educators per year (62 total) with less than 5 years of experience (preference given to the most recently hired). The program will provide educators with the knowledge, skills, and support needed for them to learn engaging and creative teaching/learning strategies; rethink traditional models of clinical education; write and analyze test items; design engaging simulation learning environments; use concept mapping effectively; assess learning to validate student success; develop and use evidence-based clinical evaluation tools; and improve student completion and retention rates.
The proposed IEDRC project, the Nursing and Allied Health Educator Bootcamp and Support Program, will benefit all regional colleges with these highly needed nursing and allied health programs that want to participate, including: Copper Mountain College, College of the Desert, Victor Valley College, Riverside City College, Mt San Jacinto College, Chaffey College, and San Bernardino Valley College. These colleges are a fair representation of the colleges with the IEDRC region.","According to LMI, including a recent report from the Center of Excellence that identifies the Top 100 Middle-Skill Occupations in Riverside County for 2016-2021, the following healthcare careers are listed in order of current and anticipated need: #6-Registered Nurses (5,387 anticipated new jobs); #12-Nursing Assistants (3,898 new jobs); #17-Medical Assistants-2,676 new jobs); #22-Home Health Aides (2,228 new jobs); Licensed Vocational Nurses (1,762 new jobs); # 27-Dental Assistants (1,679 new jobs); and #94-Dental Hygienists (383 new jobs). Further, LMI indicates that job opportunities for Health Specialties Teachers, Postsecondary, are currently high and are expected to grow much faster than the LMI average (see attached), with an employment increase of 28%, or 19,000 available positions, projected by 2024. This data supports the need for professional development, such as this project proposes, to meet the critical labor market needs for well-educated faculty to teach high demand nursing and allied health career students. As Baby Boomer educators continue to retire in the IEDRC, we must ensure we have sufficient numbers of well-trained new faculty to replace them. 

As the new healthcare faculty are trained and supported through the efforts of the proposed Nursing and Allied Health Educator Bootcamp and Support Program, data supports that an immediate impact on the Strong Workforce Program metrics of student retention and completion will be seen in the nursing and allied health students of the affected programs, as well as in the long term impact on the SWF metrics of student enrollment and graduate job placement rates. 

In order to create a viable long term pathway and to continue the premises of this Nursing and Allied Health Educator Bootcamp and Support Program, each college will include one (1) experienced educator as an attendee of the professional development offerings, with the plan being to expand that educator’s theoretical knowledge on the topic of best practices in orientation, development and support of new faculty. Those experienced educators will receive stipends to then carry their knowledge forward to develop a regionally-based bootcamp program that can be offered in the future when this SWF-funded project has concluded.
The program will occur over one (1) academic year and consist of; 1) a two to three (2-3)-day Educator Boot Camp; 2) attendance at regional HWI-sponsored and other available professional development offerings, to include the two (2)-day Innovations in Health Occupations Education Conference offered annually in January; 3) assigned mentors for new faculty with a designated yearly calendar of topics to discuss and set meetings or phone conferences (minimum of four) throughout the academic year; and 4) a culminating experience and program evaluation reception. The initial program will be offered for the 2018/2019 academic year and will be repeated for the 2019/2020 academic year. 

This project does not propose to develop non-credit or credit curriculum for students; however, it does propose that each participating experienced nurse educator from the regional colleges (7 total) will work together to divide up identified boot camp topics and then each develop at least a one-hour segment on their chosen topics. These lessons will be used in future, self-funded, regionally-offered bootcamps when this project has concluded.

A Research Assistant will be hired. A .2 FTE Distance Ed. Coordinator will be covered. Helping Hands Project will support homeless students. Family Resource Center (FRC) will provide services in life coaching, soft skills and mental health services to student parents. An Instructional Assistant will provide support to CTE students.","Students across all top codes need additional support services to be successful. To this end, we have developed a number of initiatives.
The Office of Institutional Effectiveness Fall 2016 data indicates that students who use Academic Tutoring services average 15% higher success, retention and persistence rates than those who do not use tutoring. We found that embedded tutoring in particular impacts the students performance best.  The Helping Hands Project on campus needs more support. There is a large number of students on campus who are experiencing homelessness. This population will  greatly benefit from mental health services, life coaching services, and on-going personal counseling that is currently lacking within the project.  
The Counseling Department will incorporate a missing component  that will  help students to connect their majors and classes in school across different industries and careers. Passport to Your Career will help educate students about career pathways, as well as motivate students to complete certificates/degrees/transfer by meeting with professionals in their chosen field. Workshops will include industry professionals, faculty, and academic and career counselors who together will provide well-rounded guidance to our students to in developing an academic plan and foster career development and readiness skills. This project encourages students to look at careers and industry early in their academic careers and in choosing a major. This will help solve the problem of major declaration, persistence, graduation, and positive employment because it aligns students’ academic and career goals. This program also helps to bridge the transition from school to work helping students prepare to be strong job candidates and gain positive employment. 
The FRC will partner with CTE, Workforce Training (Job Training Office) , and Cooperative Education to boost certificate completion by providing family support services, academic support such as tutoring, career exploration, and work based learning internships with units at the FRC. This project will address the fact that only 33% of student parents earn a certificate or degree within 6 years. 70% of LAVC student parents stated finding time to study was their biggest challenge. In response, “kid friendly study lounges” will be held throughout the week at multiple sites on campus. Streamlining holistic support to student parents across all CTE pathways will reach more students and produce better outcomes. Family services that contribute to CTE student success include: parent/child playgroups, family social events, parenting workshops, special needs referrals, textbook library lending, dad’s activity groups, support groups, and CPR/first aid classes. Further support includes registration assistance, career exploration, internships, tutoring, university field trips, and relevant workshops.",\n,\n,\n

"The purpose of this proposal is to support our “Projects In Common Biomanufacturing” grant project to supply local HS teachers with supplies and reagents for their biotech classes made by our SAC Biotech students to increase student awareness of biotechnology,to provide HS teachers with high quality biotech supplies and reagents manufactured by SAC Biotech students, to provide SAC Biotech students with real work based learning experience,to improve employment path from HS to SAC to biotech jobs.","Biotechnology is a field with job opportunities throughout Orange County.  Recruiting students to this field has been a struggle.  Students are scared of the term “Biotechnology”.  They find it intimidating and cannot picture themselves doing it.  

We believe a possible solution is to recruit students at a younger age by getting them to perform more advanced hands-on biotechnology experiments in high school.  One of the obstacles to this has been that high school teachers do not have access to the costly reagents necessary to run these experiments.  

Our solution, is SAC Biotech student-made reagents and supplies for high school teachers.  We believe that this will provide high school teachers access to supplies and reagents so that they can work with their students on more exciting problems while giving SAC Biotech students the hands-on experience of working in a biomanufacturing facility make actual products.  Instead of sitting in a high school class and listening to a scientific principle, the students can be engaged by actually trying out that technique for themselves.  We believe that more students would become excited by science by doing it themselves rather than just hearing about it. 

In addition, this project provides our SAC Biotech students practical experience manufacturing products, meeting deadline, quality inspecting materials, planning a process from start to finish, trouble-shooting on the fly and communicating with co-workers and customers.  They will have a chance to practice laboratory skills and soft-skills while they manufacture these products.  This will better prepared them to use these skills in internships in local biotechnology companies.   

We are utilizing several grants to help with this project.  The Projects in Common grant will be providing transportation and money for supplies.  The SAC Tech Career Pathways Trust grant is our primary pathway development grant with SAUSD.  Through this grant we are working out dual enrollment pathways as well as articulation agreements.  We have utilized a National Science Foundation Advanced Technology Education grant for equipment funding.  And the SWP Regional grant is paying for marketing, professional development, industry outreach and program coordination.  

In this grant, we are requesting a full-time storekeeper for Biotech to help coordinate media and reagent prep, track inventory, order supplies and materials, and to oversee equipment maintenance and operation equipment.  In addition, this individual would be responsible for overseeing orders placed by the high school, coordinate transportation for the deliveries and returns and inspect equipment loaned to the high schools.

With this grant we hope to increase student awareness of biotechnology by providing high school teachers with high quality biotech supplies and reagents manufactured by SAC Biotech students.  And to provide SAC Biotech students with a real work based learning experience which will improve our employment pathway from high school to SAC to biotech jobs.

"Add additional Nutrition 300 classes to increase base of potential students for the Registered Dietitian program.","In the last 10 years, American's interest in nutrition and the impact food has on their overall health has been rapidly growing. Food industries, nutritional supplement manufacturers, healthcare facilities, and similar are positioning themselves to meet this demand. It follows that, these same entities are seeking well-educated dietary, nutrition specialists to assist in gearing their product and services towards consumers. According to the Bureau of Labor and Statistics, careers opportunities for dietitians and nutritionists are projected to grow at a ""faster than average rate"" than all occupations (1). One of the hindrances for students seeking access to this growing career is the limited availability of an introductory human nutrition course - NUTRI 300. 

This gateway course establishes the foundation of knowledge needed for future dietitians/nutritionists. Without it, students are either unable to complete their coursework in a timely manner or have difficulty connecting the importance of a strong scientific base towards relaying nutrition information to future patients or clients. Increasing the available entry-level NUTRI 300 courses provides more access to our Nutrition and Dietetics Associates in Science for Transfer Degree (AS-T) . Supporting this career pathway will support student success by making the most efficient and economical use of their time in school and ultimately leading to a highly rewarding career.

This will include reviewing and assessing current strategies, pivoting where necessary, increasing investments in proven strategies and abandoning tactics that have been deemed ineffective. In an effort to expand efforts the plan also includes a concierge pilot. The pilot will include a telephone number that will provide service to potential students 24/7, as well as a chat box that can be included on the regional website, as well as the individual colleges.","The round 1 proposal is funding the development of a multi-pronged approach to marketing CTE programs regionally and leverage regional efforts with statewide “projects in common” efforts related to branding and outreach to students and employers. Continuing to fund the project will allow for greater expansion of the brand created in Round 1, and allow the region to further engage stakeholders in an effort to sustain a meaningful marketing and outreach campaign. 

Continuing and expanding the region wide advertising campaign will continue to increase awareness of Career Education programs. Marketing campaigns are successful when they provide continued touches to the target audiences over time. Developing a professional media relations plan to ensure consistent and engaging messaging will ensure the IE/DRC is able to compete with for-profit advertising.

Expanded funding will allow the consortium to develop new and innovative ways to reach stakeholders through nontraditional media and other venues. This could include professional industry sector videos, targeted outreach, and advertising at popular venues.

Additional research conducted for this report indicates a significant impact of the advanced manufacturing sector in the workforce and economy of the geographic areas studied. As automation and digital supply chain management become standard across manufacturing companies, advanced manufacturing will continue to evolve and become more complex. Top trends in advanced manufacturing impacting the workforce include automation, 3-D printing, and high-speed machining…Contributing to the dearth of skilled employees is the fact that the job growth is happening in sectors that rely on new technology. Orange County’s three largest middle-skill industries are health care, information technology, and advanced manufacturing. Together, these industries account for approximately one-half (48%) of the county’s middle-skill jobs.

"Building and expanding capacity, quality, and outreach for new Commercial Music programs. In order to serve students better through achieving SLOs, teaching planned curriculum, inviting industry professionals to campus, and developing outreach and marketing strategies, the program requires additional software, equipment, and professional services.
","•	Without ProTools and Finale software, faculty are unable to teach the course content of two Music Technology classes, Mus 35 and Mus 36. 

•	The MACCC Conference is the only conference specifically designed for Community College music programs. By attending the conference, students and faculty will learn essential tools and skills that will broaden abilities across the board. Our students can benefit greatly from workshops and masterclasses from prominent music entrepreneurs who are currently working in the field of commercial music. Students will learn from a variety of experts in the field about a great number of topics, which will help to prepare them to enter the workforce.  

•	In order to teach our Commercial Music programs effectively, we require students to take some level of piano – from beginning to advanced. Students who practice and perform on out-of-tune and poorly maintained pianos are far less likely to succeed. Due to constant temperature fluctuations in the 4000 building, we need to tune our fleet at least 4 times a year ($7000) to keep them in good working condition, and to continue to provide our students with the best possible learning environment for their music studies. 

•	 In order to encourage future enrollments in our CTE programs, as well as get the word out to the commercial music industry about us, we require funds for marketing. Marketing will include a high-quality promotional video, retractable banners, brochures, and advertising. 

•	It is essential that our fleet of 14 pianos is kept in tune for our CTE students to achieve their goals. When students play on unmaintained instruments, they are unable to perform as successfully, and they are unprepared for instruments they will face in the workforce. Currently we don’t have the funding to tune our pianos, and our students, faculty, and guest artists aren’t able to perform on maintained equipment, hampering student success. Moreover, building 4000 suffers from extreme changes in temperature, because the district turns off the HVAC during campus closures. While this saves the district money and resources, the pianos go out of tune drastically. The only solution is to tune the pianos more frequently. 

•	Currently when we wish to record a performance on the Mertes Main Stage, we are forced to use an outdated CD recording device. Often the CD runs out of space before the performance ends, and there’s a 15-minute gap missing if we need to use multiple CDs to record a longer performance. The TASCAM DA-3000 rackmount recorder is industry-standard, and will bring our facilities up to date, to the benefit of students, faculty, and our stage technicians. All files will be high quality 24-bit/192kHz PCM, the industry standard for live recording.  
•	The initial offering of Music Technology has been designed around the individual digital workstations and interfaces located in the Piano Lab (4226), which allow work with MIDI technology, mixing and editing music, and film scoring work. The second level of this class (and any additional offerings/expansions) require much more work with live sound and recording. The equipment being requested (additional microphones, cables, stands, interfaces) make the next stages of the Music Technology certificate program possible. Wenger storage for this equipment will be essential for keeping it secure.

"Las Positas College (LPC) has entered the arena of Additive Manufacturing with the addition of its first generation of Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) 3D printers. LPC will introduce a new type of 3D printing that is dominating the industry, Stereolithography Apparatus (SLA) technology. High-Tech build still needs Low-Tech tools for finishing and composing. Small hand tools are also needed to add value to the process.","Engineering makes use of the current 3D printers in numerous was; primarily in engineering graphics, introduction course, and engineering tech, students use this technology to prototype and actualize their computer designs. Currently, both courses are limited to the number of students that may print at a given time. For a given project, it may take up to 150-200 hours (non-stop) for the entire class of 25 students to cycle through the printers because a single print may take several hours (average print: 4-6 hours). Parallel printing resolves this, and will gives us the ability to add other sections of Engineering Graphics in the future, and allow for other projects to be built simultaneously.     

In addition to increasing our fleet of FDM printers we would like to introduce students to the next generation of 3D printing. Additive manufacturing is an exciting and fast moving technology that has improved tremendously over past few year. The pace of this tech has dramatically reduced the price of machines that in the past only large corporation could afford. Now even small “start-ups” have 3D printers of the highest quality. Current printers on campus are great introductory tools for 3D modeling. Indeed, these machine are necessary because of the affordability of maintenance and operation. Yet, industry moves at a pace that demands constant vigilance; the new method of printing, Stereolithography, is now available for desk top designs. Like the FDM, the SLA printing technology offers students the chance to gain experience of the tools employers are using today. 

In addition to High-Tech tools to create things, regular hand tools are import to the process of making. Currently, the engineering and engineering tech programs are limited in tool its tool box. We would like to increase this tool box by a reasonable amount. Among the tools list are parts for students to learn not only hand crafting and 3D printing, but robotics as well, as material student can learn laser cutting technics.

The foundation of the BESP project is the “Expert Network” of willing and engaged ECU faculty champions that fosters a channel for stackable credentials and credit transportability across regional colleges. The expert network develops as a learning community which thru collaboration and innovation transform the regional programs. Advancing student success by aligning content and outcomes with third-party evidence-based benchmarks and assessments leading to industry valued credentials.  

The project strives to develop solutions, such as outreach campaigns and integrating industry and academia in a campaign to address the shortfall. Aligning objectives and activities with the efforts of the Riverside County EDA/WDB, San Bernardino WDB, WIOA, and partner institutions to best address the issues of attracting, retaining, and successfully graduating students in Energy Efficiency programs. Through engaging: willing Faculty participation and administration support; agreement on Common Outcomes; Third Party-Evidence based assessment toward industry valued credential and industry advisement. Braiding available Perkins, local SWP, Prop 39 and ISPIC funding streams.

A focus on developing a workforce “Built to Industry Standards” implies a requisite engagement with employers. The project proposes establishment of “Regional Industry Advisory(ies)” to institute work-based-learning and preferred consideration employment opportunities for program completers. The “consortia” education/industry relationship can inform curriculum content and outcomes aligned to industry expectations and establish relationships enhancing student marketability and opening college resources for incumbent worker lifelong learning opportunities.  

Target Occupations include: Building Operations Professionals; Advanced lighting and automated control systems; Control systems in commercial and industrial automation; HVACR, Building Science; Energy analysis and auditing; Facilities Management; Systems Installation; Operation & Maintenance; Energy Conservation Methods; Renewable Energy (generation and storage); Construction Management; Green Architecture; Green Construction; Building Inspection Technology; and Commissioning. 

This proposal is a regional effort to align energy-related certificate programs to meet Title 24, Zero Net Energy, and Industry standards under a single degree program. The program will provide a framework for the coordination of Industry supported work experience, internships, apprenticeships, advisory panels, and the development of expert networks for advanced energy workforce development, faculty professional development, and open access curriculum materials for both credit and noncredit programs.  

Participating colleges will use their existing Energy, Construction, and Utilities (ECU) related certificates to initiate the BESP program.  The innovative structure of the BESP degree program provides 16 occupational pathways (certificates) for students with all required courses as electives, except for the Zero Net Energy (ZNE) core courses.  The ZNE core provides all students a foundational understanding of energy efficiency as it relates to buildings and energy systems.

A major focus for the first years funding will be the construction-related fields as many colleges have active and inactive programs that need updating and industry support for work experience, internships, and apprenticeships.  The BESP Consortia will engage interested and current industry partners to build a coalition of support for students and the related programs throughout the region. 

NCCER, HVAC Excellence, NABCEP, etc. are to be the primary third-party certifications and the pathway for program alignment to industry standards.  They will provide students with valuable industry-recognized credentials i.e. level one core curriculum, Ready to Work, EPA-608.  All of these IRC's are nationally recognized credentialing bodies, similar to MC3 used by the trade unions and are supported by building and trade associations like BIA, NECA, DCA and many others.

BESP qualifies for ISPIC funding, so each college will also be eligible for matching funds to implement additional BESP specialties (occupations) where LMI indicates a need and there is support from the regional consortia.  Successful implementation of the BESP Consortia will increase enrollments in ECU programs and provide more and better CTE.","Inland Empire/Desert region colleges have a significant portfolio of programs related to the energy market transformation, and a number of mechanical and electrical career pathways, many of which need to be upgraded to address emerging competencies in energy efficiency.  This region offers an ideal platform to develop strategies, best practices, and evidence that can be replicated and scaled.

The BESP Consortia project is informed by and has evolved through inputs from industry, policymakers, economic development agencies, faculty and Deans across the region. Colleges that are participating in this initiative offer programs in Process Control, HVACR, Environmental Technologies, Water/Wastewater, Building Automation, Architecture Engineering and Technical drafting technologies, Electronics and Systems Automation, Construction Crafts, Inspection, Welding Technologies, Construction Management and Data Analytics.  

Economic, public policy and labor market research are the primary drivers for this project:
•Annual demand for the target occupations in Riverside and San Bernardino County is 7000+ versus 269 
•New competencies are needed in all target occupations to accommodate industry trends in Energy Efficiency statutory goals and new/retrofitted building code compliance
•Technology is changing the way projects are managed, how materials are produced and the building process itself. The introduction of new technologies has helped to streamline, automate and speed up building design and construction
•Policies and incentives arising from California’s clean energy and pollution reduction mandates continue to accelerate industry’s evolution to automated solutions
•Clean Energy and Pollution Reduction Act of 2015. the Governor has called for a new set of objectives in clean energy, clean air, and pollution reduction for 2030 and beyond. 1) To increase from 33 percent to 50 percent, the procurement of our electricity from renewable sources. (2) To double the energy efficiency savings in electricity and natural gas of retail customers through energy efficiency and conservation.
•Existing Buildings Energy Efficiency Action Plan (EBEE Action Plan) in September 2015. The plan provides a 10-year roadmap to activate market forces and transform California’s existing residential, commercial, and public building stock into high-performing and energy- efficient buildings. 
•Policies and incentives for adoption of energy efficient systems are at the core of California’s strategy for economic growth and competitiveness in the global market

Legislation such as Proposition 39 and Title 24 (CA Building Code) continues to create new jobs by infusing hundreds of millions of dollars annually in energy efficient buildings and by incentivizing new private investments. New technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Direct Digital Control, Smart Sensors, Analytics, evolving HVACR and environment and control systems, Automated Building Controls, and Artificial Intelligence dominate the way buildings and processes must respond to these drivers.    In addition to the supply/demand and new worker competency gaps, multiple studies show a massive need to upskill the incumbent workforce. 

The foundation of the EC&U sustainability project is the “Expert Network” of willing and engaged cross-sector Faculty Champions that fosters a channel for industry-driven competencies, common outcomes, stackable credentials and credit transportability across regional colleges. The expert network develops as a learning community which thru collaboration and innovation transform the regional programs. Advancing student success by aligning content and outcomes with third-party evidence-based benchmarks and assessments leading to industry valued credentials. Exploring and implementing work experience and internship programs.  Recognizing existing demands on faculty, this project assists in curriculum alignment and development by funding consultants to work at the direction of faculty.  It also provides funding for adjunct instructors and guest lecturers to deliver specialized content modules that are infused into existing courses and programs. Professional development opportunities and access to available online and virtual training and assessment program augmentation tools. 

The Sustainability Pathways has a primary focus of engaging and expanding an existing Industry Advisory comprised of the Association Energy Engineers, Siemens, Johnson Controls, Honeywell, ABM, Association of Air Conditioning Contractors (ACCA) ASHRAE, International Facilities Management Association, So California Edison, UA250, Operating Engineers local 501, and others with a strong presence in the county.   Significant contributions to this advisory are being made by UC Davis, the Southern California HVACR Collaborative, and the National Science Foundation BEST Center.

This initiative includes: 
•Alignment of student learning outcomes across the region’s programs
•Transfer of certificate or degree-level credits across participating colleges
•Convening and sustaining an Expert Network that engages industry in faculty planning
•Professional development for faculty, aligned with industry priorities
•A community of practice for sharing curricula and building evidence for replication and scaling
•Engagement of consultants to support faculty in curriculum alignment and development
•Assessment of outcomes and continuous improvement of processes
•Opportunities for braided funding enhancement thru Prop 39, Projects in Common and SWP Local share investments and leveraging multiple funding streams for investment i.e equipment, etc.


What is BESP?
There are sixteen BESP specialties that are directly related to high demand jobs for California’s advanced energy workforce.  The names for the specialties should be consistent, but do not necessarily need to be the same as the individual certificate names.  This is important because every college will have different names for similar energy efficiency related certificates and the courses will vary by name, number, and scope.  To control this, program learning outcomes (PLO’s) will be tied to a select IRC for each specialty with those competencies reflected in the student learning outcomes (SLO’s) for the individual courses.
All courses outside of the ZNE core are elective and provide students the ability to pick the courses they need for their specialty, career, job upgrade, or other need while completing their degree.  Additionally, the courses are overlaid to encourage stacking.  Many of the advanced energy related certificates contain duplicate courses depending on each college’s curriculum, so providing the overlay helps students decide the most efficient and effective approach to multiple certificates within the BESP program.
The state recognized BESP program model has an unlimited number of available courses including entrepreneurial courses which make up the (18 unit) BESP Entrepreneurship Track.  This degree track is for energy students who want to start a business in their field of study.  Ideally any college could adopt all or some of these existing courses and begin instruction immediately if they have existing courses already on the books for similar certificates.  This would be accomplished by aligning SLO’s and PLO’s to meet the industry standards and then adding their course to the elective list under each specialty.
The goal for the Building and Energy Systems Professional, Associate of Science Degree (BESP) is to provide the student with the entry level skills, knowledge, and industry driven competencies to successfully enter and succeed in the Building Science and Advanced Energy Systems fields.

"This Round 1 continuation proposal would expand a dynamic entrepreneurial certificate program in partnership with other entrepreneurial organizations and five partner colleges. According to the Northern California Small Business Development Center, small business start-ups in the greater Sacramento area, and especially Placer County, are expected to increase 10-22% for the 5-year period 2014-2019. This proposal will prepare students for these business development opportunities.","Nearly every community college in California provides coursework or program offerings to support entrepreneurs and small business owners. However, there are potential gaps or opportunities to supplement curricular offerings for these individuals Based on research conducted for this report, the following action steps are recommended for California Community Colleges: • Work with Business and Entrepreneurship Centers (BEC) to facilitate creation of industry cluster-based entrepreneurial networks • Develop entrepreneurship programs based on regional industries • Adapt curriculum and course offerings to reflect both small business ownership and entrepreneurs • Offer specialized entrepreneurial coursework • Course offerings should include local, state, and national policy regarding entrepreneurial efforts. 
Doing What Matters identifies small business and ""gig"" (contract/freelancers) workers as one of the top sector priorities http://doingwhatmatters.cccco.edu/. Small business is also one of the three priority sectors in the Greater Sacramento Region. Data on employment opportunities do not adequately address small business and entrepreneurship because entrepreneurs are creating jobs, not applying for jobs. Studies on Home-Based Businesses for the Sacramento Region and the Far North Region were produced by the Centers of Excellence of the California Community Colleges (Far North Report) and Economic and Workforce Development office of the California Community College as part of Doing What Matters for Jobs and the Economy. Home-based businesses are defined as employing four or fewer workers. In the Sacramento Region there are 10,430 home-based businesses and one out of three of these businesses earns revenues higher than $500,000 annually. These home-based businesses are about 10.5% of all businesses in the area and 16% of the microbusiness. In the Far North Region, there are 6,940 home based businesses and nearly 30% of these businesses earn revenues higher than $500,000 annually. There are nearly 7,000 home-based businesses in the Fa North economy, which represents about 12% of all businesses and 18% of micro-businesses in the area. According to the Centers of Excellence study, to address the skills gap in the Far North Region, local community colleges can implement the following: • Integrate workplace skill training into existing career and technical education (CTE) programs and/or add workplace skill courses to CTE programs as a requirement or prerequisite. • Strengthen partnerships with local businesses to increase the number of internships or job training opportunities to students. Work experience gives students an edge in the hiring process by giving them the experience needed to demonstrate technical skills. It also gives students a chance to practice and apply soft skills learned in the classroom in the work environment. • Create and promote a mechanism that connects community college graduates with local small businesses that have open positions, such as a job board, career fairs, or direct announcements targeting specific industry groups. • Offer and promote free or low-cost workshops or training seminars for the incumbent workforce to raise skills of ‘poor performers’ and those interested in advancing in their careers. Topics of most interest to local employers include: accounting/QuickBooks, social media/online ecommerce, and business plan development. Other workshops of interest include: customer service, basic computer applications (MS Word, Excel & Outlook), leadership and supervisory skills, and human resource management. 
The proposed entrepreneurship program will offer a 21-unit interdisciplinary degree with a focus on social entrepreneurship requiring units from the entrepreneur's interest areas or discipline. A 9-unit skills certificate will provide students practical skills to establish a small business and provides a stackable certificate should the student decide to acquire further entrepreneurial skills and knowledge. This certificate provides foundational business skills for entrepreneurs in any discipline---from photographers, music artists, fashion designers, childcare providers, personal trainers, agriculture, nutritionists to contractors in construction, the educational path is flexible and customizable to fit students’ needs. This new entrepreneurship program provides students with classroom learning mixed with apprenticeships and internships to help them launch new ventures. The program offers a robust core of business classes for those interested in starting a business with an opportunity to focus on managing capital. We also want students leaving this program to have a solid understanding of accounting practices for their enterprise. An exciting component of this new program includes courses to help students identify and design sustainable, socially-minded business opportunities. It is our goal to have students leave this program with an understanding of accounting practices for their enterprise.
This proposal creates an Interdisciplinary 21-Unit Certificate of Achievement. Support for developing the program at each participating college will be provided. In addition, this program will provide a faculty Coordinator position to assist with: • Developing new for-credit curriculum. • Sharing this new innovative program across the region starting with Yuba and Woodland Colleges. Additional colleges in the North are welcome to participate. This process would then create a standardized Interdisciplinary Entrepreneurship Program that could be offered throughout NFN. • Work with the Lake Tahoe Community College to create an entrepreneurship/small business pathway. • Design Business & Customer Service Academies. Connecting with regional makerspaces, incubators, and accelerators. This allows for connection to industry, curriculum relevancy, internship/mentorship opportunities, training for faculty, and access to CTE advisory members. • Sharing information about how to develop makerspaces. • Working with Deans at Sierra, Cosumnes River College, Yuba and Woodland Colleges to focus on minority and women entrepreneurial students. • Developing regional resources.

"FUNDED ROUND 3 ONLY. This project addresses the Employability/Soft Skills gap identified by both private and public sector employers by serving non-traditional students while simultaneously creating employment and educational pathways consistent with labor market needs and college developed pathways.  It also provides the participating college districts with the tools to develop enhanced noncredit programs which generate the same FTES as for-credit programs.  With most districts experiencing an overall decrease in the for-credit student population, this alternative funding source is vital as districts attempt to stabilize funding.  ","This project addresses the need for employability and soft skills training.
To increase career tech enrollments and placement into career tech jobs by enrolling previously underserved student populations.
To promote articulation and pathways between the community and local area colleges.
To develop and promote noncredit instruction as an alternate revenue stream.

These courses are a prime part of ARC’s Mission to assist student “…to achieve knowledge, skills and attitudes for post-secondary education success, personal enrichment, self-development, and a purposeful and meaningful life as a member of a global community.” Many of these courses also meet ARC’s mission to help students obtain “Career and technical education to achieve employment or enhanced career skills for job advancement.”  The Commercial Music Instructional Assistant assist the Commercial Music department faculty to provide an environment which is conducive to meeting the following Institutional Student Learning Outcomes:
•	Demonstrate skills and behaviors which contribute to open and respectful communication of diverse ideas and beliefs.
•	Utilize a variety of methods to communicate effectively.
•	Employ strategies to work cooperatively and effectively with others.
•	For students earning degrees, demonstrate an understanding of the basic content and methodology for the major areas of knowledge, including the arts and humanities, quantitative reasoning, the natural sciences, and the social sciences.
With the completion of the F&AA modernization and expansion projects, we now have 2 state-of-the-art recording studios. These studios will support our rapidly expanding recording degree and certificate programs. Unfortunately, student access to open lab times and to do recording projects for music department and class assignments is restricted due to the limited number of hours that the instructional assistant is available. It is impossible to find enough time to meet these hours plus accomplish much needed maintenance. The adequate maintenance, repair, and checkout of equipment, as well as monitoring of open labs and recording projects requires a full-time instructional assistant.

The outcomes will be increased enrollment and increased completion numbers.  ","The program improvement issue is that the organizational structure of the Career Education and Workforce Development (CEWD) Division prior to Round 1 was not effective.  At that time, the ongoing staff consisted of the Dean and a Director.  This Director had served as the Project Director for the following grants:  CTEA, CTE Transitions, OC Pathways, SA TECH, NOCCAP, CTE EF 40%, CTE EF 60%, Round 1 SWP, SB 1070 Boot Camp and SB 1070 CATEMA.  In order to meet grant deliverables, she had been responsible for identifying and hiring faculty and short-term classified staff.  This included training these classified staff who are limited to 25 hours per week and 39 weeks total per Human Resources regulations.  Many short-term hires did not stay for 39 weeks since they found better job opportunities.  In a 4 ½ year period, there had been 12 short-term hires to assist with the various grants.  Furthermore, the additional duties of the Director included assisting faculty and administrators with the regional and state program approval processes for new CTE programs, assisting with Advisory groups, performing CTE outreach, coordinating CTE events such as Manufacturing Day and SunPower Solar Academy, updating the CTE brochure and other duties in support of CTE program improvement and student success.  

The proposed organizational structure includes the following positions:  Senior Account Clerk (FT), Administrative Secretary (FT), Student Services Coordinators (2 FT), a Research Analyst (PT—25% of a full-time position), and a short-term High School & Community Outreach Specialist.  The current Director would serve as the Project Director for the CTEA, OC Pathways, SA TECH and NOCCAP grants.  The hiring of permanent staff will allow the CEWD division to strategically plan so the needs of business and industry, the students, and our community can be met.  Outreach to employers and potential students, building lasting and fruitful partnerships, using data to make informed decisions about our current and future CTE programs and students, and marketing our CTE students’ successes to our community is the future focus of the CEWD division.

"The Los Rios Community College District Global Trade and Logistics (GTL) programs will partner with its public and private sector partners in a regional collaborative effort to introduce new global trade and entrepreneurship educationally based programs within the North region and its rural communities. These programs will create global business competency, fluency and proficiency in our workforce in all industry sectors which the North region as identified as priority sectors.  ","In 2014 California exported $174 billion of products world-wide. Of the 19.2 million California labor force, 4.7 million jobs are related to global trade. One in ten California small businesses are exporting. The businesses and labor force in the North region are no different. With the addition of over $1Billion in new export sales of product and services in 2015, as publicly reported by the US Department of Commerce International Trade Administration for the Sacramento- Arden Arcade Metro Region, business demand for job seekers who are globally proficient and globally competent is unmet and there is are just a few training programs at the community colleges that currently provide these skills. According to the same federal agency, their data shows that the $1Billion in new export sales were made by the industry sectors the “next economy” identified as the top sectors in the North Region. The federal government estimates that for every $1m in new export trade, approximately 5 jobs are either retained or created.    $1Billion X 5=   Is a big impact on jobs and industry in this region and, jobs with global trade duties pay 16% more in wages as reported by the US Department of Commerce Manufacturing and Services Economic Brief July 2010. When we include the agricultural businesses and workforce located in the rural communities which dominate the North state, the need for global trade knowledge and job skills increases, since fully forty-six percent of California’s agriculture businesses sell globally.

Global trade is not an industry sector or a set of jobs but rather a compilation of expanded workforce job skills and business knowledge that cross cuts all priority industry sectors and their LMI supported CTE needs statewide. As such, this program integrates the global trade skills into existing interdisciplinary programs to increase the number of students that are prepared to compete into the global marketplace.

This is a program that will integrate global trade skills into existing curriculum so that students are better prepared for jobs and careers that require global proficiency and competency. In addition, this program will connect students to hands on activities that will better prepare them for the global marketplace. 
Teaching global competency in a career-focused context gives students the opportunity to acquire
the job skills needed for success in many careers that are part of the region’s economy. Although the LRCCD GTL center has created two high enrollment global business courses (Bus 355, Bus 356) and an 18 unit for credit Global Trade Certificate course within LRCCD, a more effective, sustainable approach is to integrate global themes and content into existing coursework, not  separate global CTE classes. The themes included in this narrative are intended to provide support for CTE educators as they seek to incorporate global competencies into their own CTE curriculum. This will lead to greater engagement and achievement of students as well as provide a pipeline of workers and lifelong learners who will be able to engage globally and grow the region’s economy.",\n,\n,\n

The platforms will also allow us to facilitate program outreach in each of the areas.The Mobile Public Safety Training Platform will allow smaller programs that lack the current resources of established programs the ability to grow their programs quicker while providing training uses the most current equipment.  It will also allow all programs the ability to reach out to our educational partners and local community to highlight the educational opportunities our campuses have to offer in the field of public safety.","The region has several smaller fire technology, law enforcement training, emergency Medical Technician, and Paramedic programs that would benefit from being able to use simulation training to sharpen their physical skills.  Some of the colleges have limited space and this would allow them to training with this advance equipment without the need to have a location to store it when not in use.  The mobile training platform can also be use to highlight our programs with potential students by exposing them to the type of training they will receive and the job opportunities available to them.According to the labor market data, in Emergency Medical Technician and Paramedics there will be a 19% increase (1,050) of job openings through 2021.  In Law enforcement there will be an increase of 10% (3,500) of job openings through 2021.  In firefighting there will be an increase of 13% (1,360) of job openings through 2021.  ",\n,\n,\n

"The goal of this project is to continue and expand the Sub-regional Incubator and Makerspace proposal established under Strong Workforce Round 1, which included 4 colleges. This current proposal expands and builds upon those initial 4 colleges to include 9 colleges in total. The purpose is three-fold: 1) to help budding businesses gain the tools needed to start a business, develop their product concepts, and survive for more than five years, 2) to teach students about entrepreneurship, the product development process, and design thinking, and 3) to expose more of our community to STEM career pathways which will support industry needs. By creating resources in community spaces that reach new members of our communities, we can create new pipelines of students to increase FTES at our colleges and better support industry by providing more skilled students. For every 2 jobs that require a Bachelor’s Degree, there are 7 that require skilled training without a degree. 

This proposal is truly a cross-sector proposal that includes Small Business, Entrepreneurship, ICT, Digital Media, Manufacturing, Engineering, Transportation, Healthcare, etc. This will bring the DSNs, surrounding cities, Small Business Resource Centers, workforce development, and K-12 partners together, which will benefit the entire region and community colleges by providing more resources and exposure to career pathways to the students in the region. The makerspaces will be able to do tours, after-school programs, and summer programming for the K-12 systems. This will also create an opportunity to offer dual enrollment at the high schools with the new curriculum that is created along with existing programs. The incubators/makerspaces create an opportunity to work more closely with industry and our K-12 systems. This will ensure sustainability and increase FTES at the colleges in these skilled programs.

Each Incubator and Makerspace will have something unique to offer and should enable students to attend courses and trainings relevant to their field of study, at any of the proposed facilities. Regional collaboration helps meet the needs of our students by offering more CTE courses and certificates at the facilities, increasing FTES. It meets the needs of entrepreneurs, start-up businesses, and existing businesses by offering credit and/or non-credit Entrepreneur courses, and with the SBDC Collaboration will provide a more supportive environment for innovation. It also ensures economic development for our cities with the creation and expansion of local businesses and the preparation of a workforce skilled for the new innovation-driven economy.","Only 66% of new businesses survive their first year, and only 50% survive at least five years thereafter. Business incubators and maker spaces are critical in helping new businesses survive because they help entrepreneurs stay on track through mentoring and leadership development. This proposal is for a 3-year program designed to give students the knowledge and tools needed to help start and grow their businesses. Community Colleges across the region that expressed there is a need for business incubators and makerspaces that are easily accessible to students studying entrepreneurship and technology. There is a gap in entrepreneurial and technology studies in which students do not have a dedicated location to explore entrepreneurship or the tools to develop product prototypes.
 
This proposal would allow each participating college to have a makerspace and/or incubator available to students studying entrepreneurship and technology. Each faculty will have its own equipment composition, and character, designed to support curriculum in the product development, invention, or engineering, based on each college’s program needs.  The program will explore the development of “Design Thinking” course incorporating engineering-like problem solving and project management as a fundamental skill set, and possibly providing another option for meeting the computing-related general education degree requirement. It will also provide professional development opportunities for faculty that may wish to incorporate these entrepreneurship, product development, and problem solving skills to existing curricula.
 
The maker space model creates a pathway for students into CTE fields while also reaching nontraditional students that may be apprehensive to attend college such as working adults. This model will allow seamless access to high school and middle school students that are becoming engaged and motivated through maker-space supported programs and wish to continue their exploration at the community college level, thus creating an effective pathway from middle school through community college and on.",\n,\n,\n

2. Paid Internships
3. Promote the program in the region to increase enrollment. ","1. The current LIBT classroom is not adequate to support program needs, particularly given that the library profession requires strong technology skills.

"START UP IN ROUND 2-NORCO ONLY. We will map MOSs, Ratings, and AFSCs to CTE programs within 3 districts, allowing us to issue guaranteed college credits to veterans before they apply to the college. Subsequently, we will develop a statewide, public, searchable, “militaryassist.org” solution, building the database needed to sustain a national military-to-college articulation platform, including a training crosswalk for any community college interested in implementing the model. ","All veterans leave the military with a MOS, Rating or AFSC, depending on their branch. These classifications are associated with each veterans’ job in the military and the corresponding training. 
At the Spring 2011 plenary session, delegates from the Academic Senate for California Community Colleges passed Resolution 18.04 that urged local senates to apply credit for educational experiences during military service toward the associate degree – including the fulfillment of general education, major coursework, certificates, and other degree requirements – in accordance with the recommendations listed in the American Council on Education (ACE) Guide to the Evaluation of Educational Experiences in the Armed Services. Giving veterans due credit for their military experience will result in more veterans graduating from our colleges more quickly, and will help ensure the success of our veterans at our public postsecondary educational institutions.

However, while colleges are allowed to grant college credit for military work experience and training, no public college or university has established a thorough and comprehensive articulation process communicating to veterans in advance how many units they will receive at a given institution. Under our current system, veterans wishing to demonstrate comparable skills and understanding of course content must first apply to a specific college and then undergo a manual and cumbersome evaluation process only to then learn how many credits that institution will grant them for their military training and education. This process usually results in credits that fulfill few, or no, requirements for the degree beyond counting toward the minimum number elective credits – all because of inadequate articulation services. This is a national embarrassment and we are going to fix this here in the Inland Empire.

In most cases, a veteran’s military specialty is a career & technical education area. The Inland Empire Regional Consortium of Community Colleges can become more “veteran friendly” in the acceptance of academic credit, increase veteran enrollment in CTE programs, and increase the number of CTE program completers by doing the following:
1)	Ensuring all our college’s establish a policy to award credit for military coursework at the appropriate level as recommended by the ACE guide. 
2)	Evaluate and publish in advance the alignment between a veterans’ military education/training/experience and CCC coursework, organized by college, to identify military credit that may fulfill CTE certificate/degree requirements. 

By spring 2018, we will hire 4 dedicated CTE Veteran Articulation officers and a Project Director to map MOSs, Ratings and AFSCs to CTE programs across three colleges/districts with a distinct focus (Crafton Hills – emergency & public safety, Norco – engineering/computing technologies, San Bernardino Valley College - aeronautics/automotive/diesel, and MSJC - healthcare), allowing us to issue guaranteed college-credit communication to veterans before they apply to our colleges. In the fall of 2018, we will start the processes of mapping military experience and training to all CTE programs in each college’s entire catalog.  Once we have completed our internal processes, we will develop a national solution, similar to assist.org, building the database needed to sustain a national military-to-college articulation platform. This project shall include professional development and assistance for any regional community college interested in participating and implementing the model. There is widespread confirmation of this need among prominent military groups (CalVet and VA) for a “militaryassist.org” website. The SWP subgroup believes this will directly impact the pathway of military veterans into CTE programs positively raising CTE enrollments and CTE program completions.",\n,\n,\n

This proposal continues to provide for job developers at each of the area community colleges.  These individuals will be primarily responsible for seeking out jobs in their respective areas for students graduating in CTE programs and credentials.  These ""Regional Job Developers"" will work with college/district job developers to identify jobs that may be available in areas where the college does not offer the CTE program, but it is offered at one of the other colleges.  The job developers would then seek out students within the identified industry skills to match the job opening and facilitate the candidate matching, interview process, and job placement with the companies identified.

"The Retail/Hospitality/Tourism work group proposes a regional collaborative to develop a library of Hospitality related training modules that can be provided to all colleges in the region as the backbone for credit or non-credit curriculum, not for credit contract education courses, career readiness workshops, high school pathway presentations, and WIOA training requirements. 
Modules will be developed by individual faculty from participating colleges who attend training seminars at Disney and Ritz Carlton to ""learn from those who do it best"" in the area of customer service and who also possess expertise in specific industry important Hospitality and Retail areas like banquet serving and fast food operations. 
Modules will be coordinated and distributed to all interested colleges in the region through a part time Coordinator who will also fill the role of liaison to the state Sector Navigator for Hospitality in this region which does not have a DSN for that sector. ","The Centers of Excellence report on Hospitality and Tourism shows a very positive projected job growth between 2015 and 2020.   Customer Service representatives are expected to increase by 2000 jobs and First Line Supervisors by almost 3000 jobs.  According to Wendy Frederick, our local Workforce Development Board has identified Hospitality as so important in the East Valley that they are dedicating an entire Summit specifically to address these job opportunities and training needs. 
Unfortunately, students frequently see jobs in the Hospitality industry as low wage entry level positions that do not lead to a career.  And industry advisory committees report that the students in the entry level positions do not have the Customer Service orientation needed to progress into the higher level jobs. 
This project will attempt to address both of those issues by developing the customer service training students need and by also creating a regional Culinary Arts/Hospitality /Retail Tourism collaborative that will support the development of regionally aligned strategies and structured industry-informed pathways designed to seamlessly transition students high school and adult school students to community college and possibly university programs of study.  There is no DSN in our region for this sector; this Coordinator will provide the needed liaison contact with the state Sector Navigator for Hospitality. 
Faculty participating in the project will be encouraged to develop customer service and industry specific modules that present hospitality and retail jobs as attractive career pathways.  Disney and Ritz Carlton ""do it best"" and learning from them will provide community college faculty with a new perspective on ways to present the industry training that will provide higher wages for students.

"The Small Business and Entrepreneurship Curriculum Alignment proposal intends to regionally align community college business curriculum. This will allow the creation of a method to identify coursework in the same way from college to college. In addition, the curriculum will be aligned not only with the community colleges, but also with our K-12 partners, universities, and industry partners. The purpose behind this is to provide business and industry a more qualified and robust workforce base, giving employers the certainty that the entry level employees will have the skills they need.  It also ensures that transfer students will meet the prerequisite requirements for future courses. Curriculum alignment also increases student’s portability between community colleges and guarantees they receive credit for completed coursework, decreases duplication of effort, and increases their ability to complete a pathway.

This proposal includes the development of an 18-unit regional credit and/or non-credit Entrepreneur Certificate program, which will incorporate various stages of entrepreneurship (explorers, beginners, and experienced). Also included will be the development and/or adoption of “Gig” Economy course modules, such as direct selling, social media marketing, sales courses, and introduction to customer relationship management software. Training specifically for Non-Profit organizations will be developed, as this was identified as a skills gap by our industry partners.  Job Preparedness (Soft Skills) training courses will be developed for one-day workshops, and traditional coursework, as this has been identified as the most prominent  skills gap. Design thinking course modules, including process and system design, would also be developed. These new certificates and courses can be offered at any of the regional Community Colleges, incubators, or maker spaces, which not only benefits our students and skills builders, but allows business owners to become students in order to learn necessary skills for expanding their businesses and becoming more successful.

The proposal would have regional community college business faculty working with the academic senate and industry partners to ensure that all curriculum is in line with industry needs.  The curriculum will be developed and evaluated with the assistance of the Regional Advisory Communities Strong Workforce Project.  The Advisory Communities, includes members from Business and Industry, both San Bernardino and Riverside County government, K-12, CC faculty and DSNs, makes the group uniquely qualified to provide faculty with the input needed to develop strong relevant curriculum. The Advisory Community project is working to establish a business driven model that utilizes a skills panel format. This format gives business and industry the opportunity to share information and educators the opportunity to listen and respond to the information being shared. The Small Business Deputy Sector Navigator will oversee the project, and all faculty and Academic Senate members will receive a stipend for their time. (Victor Valley College will act as the fiscal agent distributing the stipends to the faculty member from each college and academic senate representatives as they meet the stipend requirements.) ","Currently every college within our region has similar small business courses, but each with a unique name and identification number, which has resulted in a lack of cohesiveness. Regionally aligning all small business curriculum would provide portability of units. Many of our students geographically move throughout Southern California, and this alignment would allow them continue on their educational journey without having to start over at each college.  This will decrease confusion, and increase student equity and success. More completions will result in more students leaving our campuses trained and ready for the workforce. This is a win for all entities involved.

The aligned curriculum would also alleviate the need for multiple advisory meetings throughout the year, which overburdens our industry partners.  The Small Business Advisory Community would convene once yearly to address changing employment needs and ensure that curriculum continues to be relevant. Employers would then be confident that their entry level employees or skills builders would be receiving adequate education for the skills needed.

Presently there only a few small unit entrepreneur programs available within the region, and there is a lack entrepreneurship certificate programs. The creation of an 18 unit  credit and/or non-credit entrepreneur certificate program would allow students interested in opening their own businesses to gain the knowledge they need for a successful start up.  The adoption of “Gig” economy courses would also lend success to our students who are interested in a variety of business models.  The incubators supported by our cities, maker spaces being created at our community colleges, and existing co-working spaces would all be able to use these modules to expand FTES, and gain apportionment funds which would lead to sustainability.",\n,\n,\n
"NOT FUNDED IN ROUND 2. This proposal is a request for continuation of the CTE Advisory Communities Project funded during Round one of the Strong Workforce Program (SWP). The regional key talent have been working on developing a model for regional CTE advisories for several years. In partnership with Colton-Redlands-Yucaipa R.O.P., Inland Empire Economic Partnership (IEEP) and a variety of business and educational entities, a business driven “Advisory Communities” model was developed utilizing an industry skills panel format. We achieved key successes including:
•	Hiring a Project Director
•	Identifying a third-party to assist with meeting facilitation and logistics (IEEP)
•	Redefining the project from developing regional “CTE Advisory Committees” to “CTE Advisory Communities”
•	Developing an effective format and agenda
•	Developing a marketing strategy
•	Gaining support and buy-in
•	Hosting our first Advisory Community meeting, fall 2016.

The overarching goal of these new “Advisory Communities” is to support collaboration of community stakeholders in the Inland Empire/Desert Region; leveraging resources in an effort to align high school & post-secondary Career Pathways with the demands of priority and emerging industry needs.
With the development of “Advisory Communities”, the region is building each respective “community” by career sector. This supports both economic growth and growth in high-demand Career Technical Education (CTE) programs. With the partnerships of business/industry and educational institutions (community colleges and secondary schools), CTE Pathways are more relevant; students are prepared to meet workforce demands; and business/industry has access to local, highly-qualified employees. Ultimately, regional businesses will thrive and students will be working in a chosen career field with necessary skills and certificates, earning a living wage (or better), and prepared for additional training and education, as necessary, to reach their lifelong goals.
The first SWP Advisory Community project was held Friday, October 13th for the Digital Media sector.  The half-day event, held at Mind and Mill in downtown Riverside, was the ideal location for Digital Media, since it is a combination of co-work, digital media marketing agency, art gallery and event space.  
SWP Advisory Community leadership team hired a Project Director in July 2017 to oversee the day to day planning efforts and coordination with all partner agencies. Although the idea of hosting regional advisory meetings is not a new one, it was apparent that this time, we had the perfect combination of vision, resources and people to deliver one of the most effective advisories this region has ever seen. The meeting was truly business-driven as evidenced by having a digital media business location (Mind & Mill) host the meeting as well as the panel discussion that included 11 industry experts that spoke to topics including hiring practices, entry-level skill requirements, education VS technical skills and ethics. The format seats the educators as audience members while the industry experts answer directed questions.
The Digital Media Advisory Community meeting was well attended, very well-received and extremely effective at engaging education and business at the same time. Planning and marketing efforts resulted in 100+ educators and business representatives in attendance.  Business experts represented Riverside and San Bernardino Counties as well as Los Angeles and Orange Counties.   CTE faculty from the following Inland Empire Desert Regional colleges participated in the event (eight of twelve colleges were represented):
•	Chaffey College 
•	Crafton Hills College
•	Moreno Valley College
•	Mt. San Jacinto College
•	Norco College 
•	Riverside City College
•	San Bernardino Valley College
•	Victor Valley College
In addition, we had CTE faculty from K-12 school districts and R.O.P.’s from throughout both counties including but not limited to CRY-ROP, Corona-Norco Unified, Fontana Unified, Hesperia Unified, Redlands Unified, Riverside Unified, Snowline Joint Unified, Temecula Valley Unified, Victor Valley Unified, and Val Verde Unified School District.
Feedback from after the meeting included statements like “best advisory I have ever attended” and “great meeting”. “How can we stay connected with the people we met today”?
“This was a great meeting!  Informative, fun, and what a great panel to learn from.  Thank you!”  - Nikki Cook, Employment Placement Coordinator at Moreno Valley College.
Promoting a continuing sense of community, a LinkedIn group for each sector meeting will be created and all attendees will be encouraged to join. This will provide a great method for business people and educators who attend the meetings to maintain partnerships after the meetings. In addition, we plan to utilize the “communities” to identify business partners that are willing to connect with the high schools and community colleges outside of the meetings to assist with the following:
•	Internships/externships
•	Job shadowing opportunities
•	Guest speaking
•	Site tours
•	Donations of equipment and funding
•	Industry experts to serve as panelists
As part of the project, pertinent information is collected and maintained in a regional database and shared with advisory community members, CTE faculty, and other key stakeholders as needed.  
This funding will provide additional “Advisory Communities” Industry Skills Panels, in the following sectors: Advanced Transportation; Information and Communications Technology (ICT); and Small Business/Entrepreneurship.  Prior to the event, a Employability Skills Survey is completed and results are shared with participants.  The meeting agenda will always include an industry panel and sub-sector focused breakout sessions.  All participating educational institutions will receive a packet following the event with all documentation to meet CTE requirements.
In addition, funding will be used to promote curriculum review, revision and new curriculum development.","Although this project has experienced success, there is still work to do to make this a truly effective, regional model. We will increase our marketing, maintain ongoing buy-in, and expand to include additional sectors. In addition, will develop a regional work group that can assist the project director with oversight of the project and expansion into geographic areas of the region to include additional partners and sectors.
•	Educational institutions at all levels are required to hold at least one advisory committee meeting per academic year for Career and Technical Education Programs
•	Business and industry partners are asked to participate in far too many meetings by multiple agencies causing meeting fatigue and burn-out
•	Although advisory meetings have a long history, the format and method are often ineffective and one-sided; A business-driven model is needed so educators can listen, actively hear and be responsive to business rather than the other way around.",\n,\n,\n
"The Inland Empire CyberHub Centers project will establish a multi-college, regional cyber-security support network that will help the region to build strong cyber-security career pathways for students. The region has existing cyber-security programs that will be strengthened and expanded with the creation of Inland Empire (IE) CyberHub centers. Colleges not currently offering cyber-security courses and pathways will be able to expand into this subject area with the help and support of the regional CyberHub centers and the CA Cyber Hub. The following Inland Empire colleges are participating in this project: Chaffey College, College of the Desert, Moreno Valley College, Mt. San Jacinto College, Riverside City College and San Bernardino Valley College. Moreno Valley College, Mt. San Jacinto College and San Bernardino Valley College’s will be adding cyber components to their campus makerspaces being established using Round One Strong Workforce Program (SWP) funding.  Using the makerspace allows leveraging EWD, SWP and other resources maximizing investments.  Riverside City College is planning to expand their existing on campus cyber-center. The remaining colleges will designate space on their campus as a cyber-center. Participating colleges will incorporate cyber into their campus and/or makerspace; support cyber-security pathways and certificate programs; become a host-site for Cyber Patriot competitions, practices and training with their high school partners; and support professional development for CTE faculty, Cyber Patriot teams, coaches and mentors. 
The CA Cyberhub support center was established during 2017 as an online resource and support system for educators and students related to cyber security, www.CA-Cyberhub.org. The CA Cyberhub mission is to enable a future ethical workforce by expanding and supporting quality cyber training across the State with a one-stop source for best practices and support resources gathered from all cyber training and competition activities in California. The CA Cyberhub primarily serves as an online resource that individuals can access when seeking support and information. 
The goal of the IE Cyberhub Centers proposal is to expand existing cyber-security programs and activities in the Inland Empire. The IE CyberHub centers will complement the online resources and offer faculty and students a physical location where they can access information, mentoring, and resources to help develop Cyber-Security programs at their colleges and schools. Establishing IE CyberHub centers throughout the region will allow us to increase cyber-security course offerings at the community colleges and to develop cyber-security pathways from secondary to post-secondary institutions.  Increased cyber-security programs and services will help our regional colleges to fill gaps identified in labor market research and data. Colleges with existing cyber centers will be able to expand existing offerings. In addition, it would provide the ideal location for regional cyber competitions, such as Cyber Patriot, to be held. The addition of CyberHub centers will also support an increase in the number of Cyber Patriot teams in our region. Students would be able to use computers to learn more about cyber-security, operating system hardening, packet tracers and other virtual environment simulations. Moreover, the physical CyberHubs would offer IT cyber-security related services and workshops to small businesses within the area. This project will provide excellent partnership opportunities for the community colleges to work with their feeder high schools and community based agencies offering cyber-security education and activities such as summer camps. 
","Think cyber crime is something only found in fiction? Think again, because online crime is a very real threat in our Internet-connected society. With 1.5 million annual cyber-attacks, online crime is a real threat to anyone on the Internet. That number means there are over 4,000 cyber-attacks every day, 170 attacks every hour, or nearly three attacks every minute (www.Forbes.com ).  It's no secret that cyber-attacks are on the increase.  Each day there seems to be a new report of a corporation being hacked or having a data breach including some prominent companies that including Sony, Target, Equifax and many more. Most of us have had our own experience of being hacked or having personal information stolen. The ISACA, a non-profit information security advocacy group, predicts there will be a global shortage of two million cyber-security professionals by 2019. Every year in the U.S., 40,000 jobs for information security analysts go unfilled, and employers are struggling to fill 200,000 other cyber-security related roles, according to cyber security data tool CyberSeek. And for every ten cyber-security job ads that appear on careers site Indeed, only seven people even click on one of the ads, let alone apply.

Our educational system is simply not producing enough skilled workers to meet the current demand. This need is soaring and expected to grow exponentially over the next decade.  The Inland Empire Desert Region community colleges need to better position themselves to meet this need and provide adequate training to students so they will be prepared to fill some of the workforce demand. Embedding the Cyberhubs into regional makerspace locations and existing Cyber centers will provide easily accessible places for the community colleges to work with partners from our secondary schools, ROPs, community based agencies and business partners.
Cyber-security workers protect our most important and private information, from bank accounts to sensitive military communications. However, there is a dangerous shortage of trained cyber-security workers in the United States that puts our digital privacy and infrastructure at risk.

In 2016 there were 112,000 openings for Information Security Analysts, but only 96,870 workers currently employed in those positions – an annual talent shortfall of over 15,000 workers for cyber-security’s largest job.

There are 200,000 additional openings requesting cyber-security-related skills, and employers are struggling to find workers who possess them. Jobs requesting cloud security skills, for example, remain open 96 days on average – longer than any other IT skill.

This proposal will establish a multi-college, regional cyber-security support network and will allow each participating college to have a CyberHub center to support students and faculty for both technology and cyber-security. Capitalizing on program success promotes the creation of additional Cyberhubs.  Incorporating a Cyberhub into a makerspace provides valuable hands-on learning opportunities for students seeking employment in a cyber-security career pathway. It also provides access to economically disadvantaged students and nontraditional students that may not otherwise have access to cyber-security education, training and activities including summer camps and team competitions. This model will also allow the community colleges to increase access to high school and middle school students creating a pathway from middle school to the community college and beyond – whether that is to a college or university or directly into employment. Partners from secondary schools and community based agencies will also reap benefits from the CyberHub centers. The centers will provide ideal locations for cyber events including competitions, practices and summer camps. This will help to build strong pathways between high schools and community colleges and increase the number of students who persevere in their pursuit of a cyber-security career.

"We are working to attract new students into our programs, including through the use of Apple's Everyone Can Code modules.","We know that there are thousands of unfilled jobs in ICT at this time, and that demand is expected to continue for the foreseeable future.  We also know that there is a strong demand for a more diverse workforce.

In an effort to help fill this need, we would like to do a better job at both recruiting and retaining more students of color and more women.  We need help with this.  Ideally, we could both create better marketing materials and hire staff, even staff shared with another division, to help us recruit, mentor, and connect students with ""wrap-around"" services which we know lead to better student outcomes.

Additionally, it is anticipated that the Everyone Can Code (ECC) project which is being launched in Fall 2018 will need to expand to include an online section to reach more students.

"LAUNCH exists to remove the obstacles faced by education and industry partners using the apprenticeship model and to present a ready-made product that employers and students can engage today.  Combining technical assistance and key talent, program and service alignment, shared messaging, broader service reach, and expansive partnerships, LAUNCH gives the region a comprehensive solution that empowers institutions, students, and employers to create dynamic stackable credentialing programs that target skills training, rewards work and learning, and delivers results.
1)	Supporting cost-effective methods and strategizing sustainability for seven individual colleges developing and expanding apprenticeship programs among five districts, with expansion strategies for colleges not immediately participating.
2)	Targeting immediate industry needs in priority labor sectors (apprenticeships = jobs)
3)	Facilitating the alignment of programs supporting apprenticeships in shared industries and occupations.
4)	Aligning and simplifying user interfaces so that employers and apprentices experience the same streamlined services and processes across the network.
5)	Marketing apprenticeship regionally – providing students with a clear and viable pathway through a career and higher wages, and employers with a clear effective method to develop their existing workforce.
6)	Broadening partnerships with regional stakeholders (i.e. high schools, WDBs, etc.) and distributing best practices and sharing resources where appropriate and beneficial.
","NEED:
Expanding the apprenticeship model beyond its current form is a difficult but worthy task. For every 1,000 apprentices we support, estimates indicate we could increase wage earning in our region by $240,037,000 over the career-span of those individuals. In addition, because they link individuals directly with employment, apprenticeships deter youth unemployment and increase youth labor force participation. In Riverside and San Bernardino County, teens have been employed at only half the rate of the national average and the employment rate for those 20 to 24 is also lagging.  Apprenticeship provides a solution because it educates and concurrently employs individuals towards living-wage careers. For example, the effective apprenticeship system in Switzerland - where many teens secure apprenticeships embedded within their schooling–has resulted in a youth unemployment rate below four percent.    Essentially, our job isn’t simply to make apprenticeship work for our colleges, our job is to make apprenticeship work for our region and its industries.  
In the past several years, apprenticeship has received popular attention in addition to federal, state and private investment.  Hundreds of millions of dollars have been invested nationwide with the expressed purpose of expanding apprenticeship into new industries and occupations.  However, progress remains slow and questions regarding long-term sustainability remain unanswered for many newly created programs.  Urban Institute fellow Robert Lerman – who has written extensively on apprenticeships in the U.S. and internationally – has emphasized the need for funding to target the development of a robust and sustainable apprenticeship system instead of focusing on individual programs.   For proof of the effectiveness of this strategy we can look to states like South Carolina, which increased from 90 apprenticeship programs in 2007 to 918 programs today, and increased their active apprentice count from 777 to 14,475.   Colleges should particularly note South Carolina’s success because a pillar of the state’s “Divisional Approach” remains the full participation of the 16 technical colleges that have integrated the apprenticeship model and provide training and education to the region’s workforce.
While institutions and employers have shown an interest in the apprenticeship model, they have faced a multitude of obstacles including bureaucratic complexities, lack of awareness, high upfront costs with slow growth projections, and lack of sustainable funding options.  To put it simply, apprenticeship seems to confuse the people (employers and students) that would benefit from it most.  For example, if a students came in to your department and asked how they could start an apprenticeship, what response(s) would they receive?  Meanwhile, countless employers are asking for a workforce that can show up on time, be ready to work, with the ability to learn.  We can provide a solution that combines work-based learning with continued education and answers an immediate need for employers, but the method needs to clear and simple, and the value needs to be shown up front.
LAUNCH represents the first largescale regional apprenticeship network in the state of California that seeks to build the necessary infrastructure for the expansion of apprenticeship and work-based learning.  We can learn valuable lessons from other models such as Apprenticeship Carolina, a Division of the SC Technical Colleges, the Technical College System of Georgia’s apprenticeship programs, and private collaborations like the Jackson Area Manufacturing Association.  We can also improve upon those models by leveraging unique and substantial California advantages.  The most significant lesson taught by all of these, however, is that collaboration through a regional approach is critical to the success of apprenticeship and work-based learning.
HOW IT WORKS:
Participating colleges will serve different functions within LAUNCH, but will work together to accomplish the following: 
•	Supporting cost-effective methods and strategizing sustainability for seven individual colleges developing and registering apprenticeship programs among five districts, with expansion strategies for colleges not participating in this round.
o	Colleges participating as “Program sponsors” will be supported through program development according to the structure and model that best aligns with their college.  Having local control over program structure allows individual colleges to leverage funding and personnel strength while building their program.
-	Key Talent and technical assistance allows the bulk of funding to be used when programs are up-and-running, and it saves up-front costs through the course of administrative processes and approvals.
-	Programs will strategize and demonstrate sustainability through enrollment growth and the braiding of funds.
•	Targeting immediate industry needs in priority labor sectors (apprenticeships = jobs)
-	College programs will be structured to respond to immediate industry needs and build long term strategies for identifying and infusing growing industry sectors.
•	Facilitate the alignment of programs supporting apprenticeships in shared industries and occupations.
-	Aligning programs in similar occupations is critical for industry engagement.  Participating colleges with work to align “work-processes” and skills for the purposes of tracking work-based learning.  This allows for greater mobility of participating employers and students, and establishes industry recognized terms and more portable credentials.
-	In addition, aligning work-processes and skills in like occupations allows programs to aggregate the demand for certain skillsets.
•	Aligning and simplifying user interfaces so that employers and apprentices experience the same streamlined services and processes across the network.
-	Programs will work to align user interfaces so that apprenticeship experiences become common and streamlined.  In other words, colleges will work together to establish streamlined processes and procedures so employers and students know what to expect when starting and completing an apprenticeship.  Program and interface alignment allows regional employers to participate in the network without needing to learn individual college nuances.
-	In addition, common interfaces allows colleges not participating in the network to enter with lower upfront costs as much of the product development will be complete.
•	Marketing apprenticeship regionally – providing students with a clear and viable pathway through a career, and employers with a clear effective method to develop their existing workforce.
-	Participating colleges will work together on shared messaging and marketing practices that promote apprenticeship and work-based learning within the region.
•	Broadening partnerships with regional stakeholders (i.e. high schools, WDBs, etc.) and distributing best practices and sharing resources where appropriate and beneficial.
-	Focusing on partnerships with regional stakeholders, such as high schools, WDBs, employer/industry associations, etc., participating colleges will deepen workforce & economic development strategies to provide more and better CTE.
-	LAUNCH will work together to develop and distribute best practices for colleges wishing to use apprenticeship in the region.
-	As programs continue to align learning objectives and services, shared resources, such as apprenticeship tracking software, will be considered and vetted by the apprenticeship network.  Again, with the intent to lower the cost of apprenticeship programs and deliver better quality to employers and students.
Roles & Functions of Participating Colleges:
There are four major roles individual colleges will play within LAUNCH:
1)	Project Lead, Key Talent, Technical Assistance, and Project Administration:
a.	Norco College will provide LAUNCH with support and technical assistance in completing the objectives listed above.  In addition, Norco College will function as the lead and will maintain administrative support for the project. 
2)	Developers and Drivers:
-	Some colleges have committed to driving the development of new programs, building new industry partnerships, serving as education providers, and function as program sponsors.  Outreach to businesses is a major focus of this group, and colleges selecting this role also plan to support regional aspects of apprenticeship – such as aligning programs and procedures with other colleges and process improvement in general.
The following colleges have committed to this role:
1.	San Bernardino Valley College
2.	Mt. San Jacinto College
3.	Chaffey College
4.	Norco College
3)	Program Sponsors:
-	Some colleges in LAUNCH have committed to serve both as education providers and program sponsors, but will not be primarily focused on program development.  Program sponsors fulfill an administrative role in apprenticeship that requires the college to complete employer acceptance agreements, track and monitor on-the-job training, liaison and submit records to apprenticeship agencies, and oversee apprenticeship agreements.
The following colleges have committed to this role:
1.	Barstow Community College
2.	College of the Desert
3.	Crafton Hills College
4)	Education Providers:
-	LAUNCH will also include colleges that wish to participate primarily as education providers within the network.  This means that they will accommodate registered apprentices enrolling in existing programs and courses, but they do not intend to administrate apprenticeships or handle employer agreements/contracts.  In addition, they will remain informed of new programs under development that align with their curriculum.
The following colleges have committed to this role:
1.	Copper Mountain College
2.      Moreno Valley College
Partners Outside of the Colleges: 
Apprenticeship is succeeding in different areas of the country based on collaborative efforts.  While LAUNCH has focused development structures around college run apprenticeship programs, this does not preclude – and in fact it is designed to encourage and support – the involvement of other institutions, agencies, programs, etc. that would like to participate in apprenticeship and work-based learning.  Partnerships that have already expressed interest in collaboration include local high schools and the regional workforce development boards.  In addition, employer and industry associations would also be welcome to participate in the network. This will also create an opportunity to deepen ties with regional building trades programs that would benefit from education partners.  LAUNCH participants will learn unique their college can work with these partners and support expanded work-based learning opportunities. 
The image above shows South Carolina’s model of expanding “pre-apprenticeship” style training through their “readySC” program.  Adult education, non-credit training, CTE certificates, high school partnerships, etc. all represent pathways to apprenticeship.  Because apprenticeship allows for varied entry points, the college system and its partners can provide an educational and economic development solution to the region that supports individuals entering and succeeding in their chosen profession.
LAUNCH is not created to be another entity, additional bureaucracy, or program, but serves as a network, resource and support for the region.
Industry Focuses, Expansion, & Sustainability
The Advanced Manufacturing sector provides a platform for LAUNCH to work through, test, and practice methods of program development throughout the region.  Because numerous industry partners have already expressed interest in using the apprenticeship model, advanced manufacturing offers an opportunity for immediate implementation and enrollments in apprenticeships while the network and programs continue to develop.  While primarily focusing on advanced manufacturing, LAUNCH also includes participating colleges that are determined to support the apprenticeship model and will provide LAUNCH the opportunity to support expansion into other industry sectors as programs develop.
For sustainability, LAUNCH pursues increased enrollment, the braiding of funds, and cost-effective methods of delivery.  Essentially, integrating apprenticeship model learning into regular college programs provides a long-term strategy of sustainability as apprenticeship is seen as a way to complete their education combined with work-based learning.  As successful models have shown us, this process takes time and collaboration as well as a “no-wrong-door” policy – meaning apprenticeship learning can start where it already fits best.  If employers or students contact any college in the region, they should have access to the same services and opportunities.

"While the demand for skilled Mechatronics Technicians is growing rapidly there are generally only a few Technicians required at each industry site. Therefore, developing training programs for incumbent workers is a challenge. There is also a need to establish education to career pathways for entry-level workers. Limited facilities exist within the region which has the resources to provide a full curriculum for Mechatronics training.","This program aligns with the Mechatronics Technician standards developed under Round One funding. This funding will allow for the development of noncredit and credit curriculum, high school partnerships and “Learn and Earn” program throughout the region as well as staffing requirements. This pathway will increase enrollment at the regional colleges that are providing credit-based programs in these areas. Currently, there are limited or no options for industry to obtain training for their incumbent workers. By developing a Mechatronics Technician Training Pathway in various locations within the region, large and small employers have more options to meet the need for a skilled workforce in their respect locations. Working with the industry, a flexible schedule can be developed and implemented to meet established goals. ",\n,\n,\n
"This proposal is a request to develop and implement a Cloud-Hosted Regional NETLAB+.  NETLAB+ is a virtual lab management and scheduling appliance that provides students with the ability to access virtual lab sessions from any location with high-speed internet access. Traditionally it is used across the California Community Colleges for Information Technology and Cyber-security training however, with its custom lab creation tool, it can also be used to create virtual labs for any curriculum requiring access to software based tools including: Automotive, Business, Health, Manufacturing, Transportation and other fields that use computerized applications and/or testing.
NETLAB+ cloud hosting helps to defray the actual cost of entry and maintenance. Cloud based deployment will greatly enhance student access to IT and Cyber security labs and training by mitigating distance and time issues.  A cloud-based system will allow access for students from any device and provide benefit to every college in the region.
Colleges wishing to participate in this project include Barstow College, Chaffey College, College of the Desert, Crafton Hills College, Moreno Valley College, Mt. San Jacinto College, Riverside City College and San Bernardino Valley College.  Several of these colleges have physical NetLab+ assets that may be leveraged in a cloud-based system.  
Virtual networks (VLAB) using the cloud allow completion of a majority of assignments currently conducted in labs using physical equipment. These virtual networks simulate the physical equipment, yet allow for quicker deployment and a wider array of configurations, as no physical layout is required. Cloud services would support students in onsite and remote courses, including those enrolled in both degree and certification programs.
A cloud environment could support other programs, such as computer coding, graphic arts, business software, math studies, etc., which rely on software for instruction. The same benefits of reduced per-student-cost, access and system support are realized by migration of these programs.  Reduction in costs of maintaining on-site support of these additional programs will result in additional cost savings to the colleges and provide sustainability.  Upon successful implementation, access to the cloud-based NetLab+ environment may be extended to high schools in the region, with potential for additional revenue and added sustainability to support the environment.
","There is strong interest and support among faculty for a cloud-based learning environment. Existing on-site equipment cannot support expanding resources to other areas needing technology.  A cloud-based system is capable of supporting traffic and workload of a greater student body. Execution of this proposal would be nearly seamless, with only negligible tweaking of lesson plans, operations and resource administration.

Information & Communications Technologies (ICT) and digital media industry groups in the Inland Empire/Desert region demonstrate positive projected job growth from 2018 to 2020. The computer systems design and related services industry group had the most jobs in the region in recent years.  Employment opportunities  for the ICT group is expected to grow 28% in the next few years, adding around 100 jobs by 2020 and having average earnings of more than $101,000 per year.

Significant efficiencies would result from a cloud configuration. At present, software licenses assigned to a specific piece of hardware, which may be in-use, but not using all software licensed to it. With virtualization, licenses are per user, as opposed to individual, pieces of physical equipment. This allows for much greater sharing and utilization of licenses. Consequently, software-licensing costs in cloud environment are between 1/10th and 1/30th of current expenditures for physical labs.

Under this proposal, limited deployment allows for the establishment of procedures, formation of advisory teams, further development of curriculum and future decisions to move forward with a broader migration. Implementation also allows for establishment of security policies and permission/privilege hierarchy, crucial to integrity of operations across any future expansion of VLAB services to additional campuses, regions or region-wide.

Benefits to the colleges through implementation of this proposal include:
•	Expanded Course Offerings
•	Increased Leverage with Vendors
•	Expedited Deployment of New Courses
•	Heightened Status as Provider of Current Technology Training
•	Rapid scalability
•	24/7 Access and Maintenance
•	Large Library of Lab Resources
•	Simulations on a Larger Scale
•	Resource Sharing
•	Lower Cost-Per-Student
•	Security Isolation

" A printing press will serve as a bridge in means of communication from several perspectives, including the real-world physicality of print, and the interaction between ink, paper, process and press. Access to printing technology will assist students in acquiring skills and knowledge they may not otherwise gain through digital media alone, and will expand  learning skills,  literature skills, and  life skills, as well as problem solving abilities.","Using the above SOC codes and TOPS codes for the Local Share Worksheet, the Occupational Demand is 122 and the Supply, or degrees and certificates for the area is 32. In addition, according to the 2016 Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) Report for the Digital Media Inland Empire/Desert Region in SOC Code (27-1024) Graphic Design, there will be a 3.4% change from 2015-2020 with 69 annual openings. The percent of total jobs in the 2016 industry group is 2.9%.
The 2016 Regional Labor Market Assessment, Inland Empire/Desert Region indicates that over a five-year period, positions in graphic will have a 5-Yr% Change of 3% with annual replacements of 54 and annual openings of 69. In the Inland Empire, the living wage for one adult is $11.75 per hour. The entry-level wage for commercial designers is $18.35, which is above the living wage for the region. 
Although we have entered the digital age, print is still alive and important to understand. The growing dependency on digital software as a single means of art creation and reproduction does not provide the broad range knowledge needed by a designer. The traditional methods of printmaking have been used over time as commercial printing methods and the present day commercial and high-tech methods are identical in principle to those in traditional techniques. Access to printing technology will assist students in acquiring skills and knowledge they may not otherwise gain through digital media alone and help in their creative and technical understanding of print media.
Implementing the identified strategies may move the Strong Workforce metrics by increasing the skill level and student engagement. According to the Strong Workforce Metrics, during the 2015-2016 period, 246 students enrolled in the courses, 202 students took more than one course, the course retention rate was 88%, the success rate was 72%.  Five students earned Chancellor’s Office-Approved Certificate and 13 students earned an AA Degree. Not all students enrolled in the courses are design and multimedia majors, as the courses also fulfill Humanities requirements. Identifying those who are majors and working with those students to develop industry skills may increase the Certificate and AA Degree numbers and affect completion rates and transfer rates during the funding period by one-percent.",\n,\n,\n

","  The machinist technology department is the only public facility within 60 miles to offer five axis training. in southern California today, leading technologies are moving into the aerospace market. the challenge for the region is to continue to support and enable its technological ecosystem, while the challenge for individual firms is to adopt emerging exponential technologies that are critical to future success in this industry.
  As the complexity of part design and precision of composite parts increases, advanced manufacturing capabilities are necessary to remain competitive within the manufacturing industry 5 axis machine tools are one of many responses to this demand. Despite the large pool of jobseekers, manufacturing companies claim they are having trouble finding skilled workers to fill open positions both in the region and nationwide. America's economy was forged by machinists. but today, a quarter of the nation's steelworkers are getting ready to retire.  Local school districts cut shop classes years ago, fewer young people are entering the trade, the result is a shortage of skilled workers to build and run the machines that run our lives. At present, there is a shortage of qualified employees, this is due very much to the fast pace of change in the field as well very few apprenticeships.

"This proposal is a continuation of expanding the Diesel program scan/diagnostic tools for each vehicle, manufacturer system, online information subscriptions, manual and automatic transmission and differential training modules and additional professional development for each year of Strong Workforce funding, up to 3 years, to ensure that labs are up-to-date and effective instruction is provided on these vehicle systems.  ","Over the past three years, college and high school faculty members in our region have been working together on professional development and curriculum standards to incorporate an introductory course in Diesel / CNG,  EV and hybrid systems. SBVC Transportation department is the only one of its kind within the Inland Empire.  The department has the state of the art latest GHG14 and GHG17 emission training modules.  The department also has the Truck / training module that has the latest technology that is used for instruction up to 2020.  The department is looking toward 2025 for expansion and is in need of newer training modules.  There is no other public entity within 100 miles equal to our standards that teach transportation.  With the closing of Victor valley Heavy Diesel department they chose to just do diesel passenger cars this leaves students with only one avenue for education in the Transportation industry. 
The Diesel department here at SBVC has partnered with local High Schools in leading the way for students that choose work after high school; We offer a very good foundation that will allow them an opportunity of success.  The current enrollment is a very successful way to not only show students a way of life, but also gives them the support and confidence needed to be successful.   
However, our facility has relationships with colleges in San Diego and Palomar and Whitter.  Funding is very small and we as a group share components to continue our efforts to keep up with the new technology that changed at the blink of an eye.  This proposal is to change the image of our lab space by acquiring state of the art work stations, vehicles and battery lifts, scan/diagnostic tools for each vehicle, manufacturer system, online information subscriptions, and additional professional development for each year of Strong Workforce funding, up to 3 years, to ensure that labs and workstations are up-to-date with safe and effective instruction.   The cost is estimated at $142111.67 for the first year.

"Executive Summary   As stated in the 2015-2016 Student Equity Plan, College of the Desert’s Plan builds on the work begun by our Superintendent/President, Dr. Joel Kinnamon, who, in January 2014, released a comprehensive “Agenda for Advancement of Student Success and College/Community Development.” One of the principal items in this agenda is the development and implementation of a student success plan, which, among other things, aims to improve students’ success in completing coursework, completing degrees and/or transferring to four year institutions, and preparing to enter the workforce. Our Student Equity Plan continues to be an attempt to realize this Agenda, to address the disproportionate access to higher education in our service areas, and to eliminate the disproportions in success rates of our student populations.    Currently, the College has a standing Equity committee, which incorporates basic skills representatives, and a SSSP/Matriculation Advisory Committee.  Both report to the College’s Planning Council with faculty appointments by the Senate.  With full constituent representation, both committees are responsible for monitoring the progress of the plans including continuously evaluating the outcomes.  The process of writing the integrated plan has illuminated for us the access and achievement gaps among specific student populations, and it has helped us formulate more targeted efforts at working with and for our students and community. In addition, as a college-wide effort, the writing of this Plan has brought together the different stakeholders at the College and has set the stage for some authentic collaboration among these stakeholders. We intended for the Plan and its constitutive activities not only to address any access and achievement gaps, but also to continue to build and sustain a more equitable and vibrant college environment for our students.    Target Groups    Based on the disproportionate impact study we undertook for this Plan, we discovered that different methodologies resulted in varied results. Because Hispanic/Latino students comprise over 70 percent of our student population (i.e., a significant fraction of our total enrollment), some of the comparison data hid important achievement gaps for this particular population. In other words, even though some of the data may not have indicated so, we found that a significant number of Hispanic/Latino students experienced an achievement gap in multiple indicators, once we took into account the “number of students impacted” and the “disaggregated subgroup’s proportion of the total population,” as recommended under the Percentage Point Gap Methodology (Attachment E). As a result of these considerations, Hispanic/Latino students are being identified as our largest target group for most indicators.    In addition to Hispanic/Latino students, other statistically significant target groups we identified were Current or Former Foster Youth, and Black or African American Students, and many of our efforts will specifically target these groups. Other groups that were disproportionately impacted in multiple indicators were American Indian or Alaska Native Students, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander Students, but because these two groups are composed of such small numbers of students, we decided not to specifically target them in our Equity efforts; instead, we designed many activities with Universal Design principles that are meant to affect all groups.  Goals and Activities  The overall goal of this Plan is to narrow any gaps from disproportionate impact studies.  The Equity committee will determine a schedule for activity constituents to report whether or not they are moving towards achieving the goal of their area.  A suggested timeline would be for activity constituents to report their progress to the Equity committee at the end of each semester. The process followed will be one of ""Action Research"" (i.e., administer the intervention, collect data, adjust, re-administer).  The committee will summarize the activity reports into a general report that will be disseminated and discussed in a meeting to key constituents of the Academic Senate, College Planning Council, Outcomes and Assessment committee, departments, schools, president's cabinet, Institutional Effectiveness committee, Educational Master Plan committee, Assessment of Planning and Outcomes subcommittee, and the Board of Trustees.  Specific goals and proposed activities for each indicator are as follows:  A. Access  Low-income Students, Graduating High School Students in Underrepresented Populations, and Communities with Low College-Going Rates are the target populations for Access. To bridge the access gap by 2% for each group, we are proposing two activities: Targeted Outreach to Low-Income and Low-College-Going-Rate Communities, and Research to Identify Underrepresented Populations not Revealed in Current Data Sets.  B. Course Completion  Current or Former Foster Youth, Black or African American Students, and Hispanic/Latino Students are the target populations for Course Completion. To bridge the course completion gap by between 3-6% for the first two groups, and to eliminate the gap for the third group, we are proposing three activities: At-Risk Counselor, Tech EDGE (technology-based bridge program), and Distance Education Faculty Development.  C. ESL and Basic Skills Completion  For this section of the Plan, we disaggregated the data into three areas: ESL, Basic Skills English and Reading, and Basic Skills Math. For ESL, the target groups are Hispanic/Latino Students and Males, with a goal of bridging the basic skills completion gap by 3% for each. For Basic Skills Math, the target groups are Black and African American Students, Hispanic/Latino Students, and Males, with a goal of bridging the basic skills completion gaps by 5%, 2%, and 2%, respectively. For Basic Skills English and Reading, the target groups are Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander Students, American Indian/Alaska Native Students, and Individuals with Disabilities, with a goal of bridging the basic skills completion gaps by up to 5%. For these three areas, we are proposing the seven activities: A Culturally Responsive First-Year-Student Experience, On Course and Reading Apprenticeship Training for Faculty and Counselors, Intrusive Counseling, Math Course Alignment and Increased Communication with Local High Schools, Self-Placement into Elementary Algebra, and EDGE (a summer bridge and extended student services support program).  D.  Degree and Certificate Completion  American Indian/Alaska Native Students, Black or African American Students, and White Students are the target populations for Degree and Certificate Completion. To bridge the degree and certificate completion gap for the first two groups by 3-4% and to eliminate the gap for the third group, we are proposing the following activities: Professional Development for Math Faculty, and Reading Apprenticeship for Math Students and Classes. E. Transfer Hispanic/Latino Students are the target population for Transfer. To increase the transfer rate for this population by 10%, we are proposing the following seven activities: At-Risk Counselor, Retention/Completion Counselor, Stipends for Faculty to Developing Marketing Materials, Tutoring in English and Math for COD Veterans, and STEM support.  Resources Resources to implement the Integrated Plan goals and activities include allocated state categorical funding for Basic Skills, SSSP, and Student Equity, general institutional funds, alumni funds, foundation funds, and staff support.

"Coastline's CTE department sees a need for an Associate Dean of CTE to oversee the department and administer Strong Workforce projects to ensure program improvement.  Increased support staff will ensure the department's activities will be appropriately monitored and facilitated. Faculty professional development fulfills the need to improve curriculum and instruction.  Marketing for Coastline's CTE programs is needed to increase enrollments.     ","The Associate Dean position will help with oversight, coordination, and supervision for all of the Strong Workforce projects.",\n,\n,\n

"With over 50 CTE programs in need of funding to increase the quality and quantity, in addition to the desire to start new programs to meet further meet labor market needs, faculty and administrators are in the process of identifying program improvement projects to move SWP metrics.  Some projects will cross sectors (marketing, code alignment, professional development, career services, etc.) and many will be sector/CTE program specific. Individual projects will be approved by June 2019.","The need for the college to establish baseline enrollment, persistence, completion and employment baseline data is imperative.  This will start with the completion of the code alignment project, professional development for CTE faculty, and utilization of both program and labor market data to drive existing program improvement and new program development. In addition,  the college will focus on increasing enrollment through investment in high school and adult school marketing and ""inreaching"" to students with undeclared majors.   Business engagement related to advisory committees and work-based learning experiences have also been identified as a need.  Curriculum development, career pathways, dual enrollment are all strategies that have been identified to support Guided Pathways, which in turn support a variety of SWP metrics.  Career and academic advising have also been identified as a need that once investments are made, we will see improved program completion and employment metrics.",\n,\n,\n

" SBVC would like to create Open Educational Resources (OER) for CTE programs, saving students hundreds of dollars in textbook cost. ","The high cost of textbooks can push countless CTE students out of college and consequently hinder both employment opportunities and the standard of living in communities. 
Free open educational resources are lacking in many CTE disciplines when compared to highly enrolled transfer and general education courses.  
Many CTE students lack developmental math, reading, and writing skills required for a technologically advanced economy. 
Adopting open educational resources is time consuming for faculty.

"Netlab+ is a server appliance provided by Network Development Group with software tools preloaded for institutions to host real lab equipment, virtual machines and lab content at a location for trainees to complete labs. The solution, hosted at Cabrillo College, allows faculty and students to access labs remotely (24x7), so they do not have to physically be where the lab is located nor purchase equipment and maintain their own lab.","This project provides vocational training for the 21st century. Bay Region colleges will be able to access top-notch training and professional certification programs remotely 24/7. Leveraging regional funds in a shared lab will save Bay Region participating colleges the required infrastructure costs from hardware ownership and maintenance, software licensing, support and employing an on-site technical support person.

"SCCCD, on behalf of its three colleges and three centers, proposes to use SWP funds to support workforce/economic development function at the district level which will coordinate college efforts and develop/enhance collaboration among the colleges and within the business/industry sectors.","Employers and community organizations continually ask for relevant, up-to-date information regarding CTE programs and services. Efforts to increase CTE enrollments and completion must be well-coordinated and communicated throughout the service region in order to be effective. This coordination and communication must include prospective students, employers, and community organizations. Employers and community agencies have identified a need for more and better partnerships leading to an improved economic development environment. Additionally, both employers and students have identified a need for coordination of programs and support services among the colleges and centers and transferability and/or portability of curriculum.

The district dean of workforce and adult education will provide overall leadership in the coordination, planning, organization implementation, evaluation, and policy development for district-wide workforce programs. A district dean will be a catalytic force to formulate, implement, collaborate, and promote career technical education and economic development throughout the State Center Community College District and regionally. This Dean serves as a liaison between the district and agencies administering district-wide workforce initiatives.

Working in tandem with staff and faculty across the district, the district dean will lead and coordinate efforts to ensure the effective delivery of relevant workforce preparation, economic development and training programs across the SCCCD service region. A district dean can serve in this capacity while coordinating district efforts with those of the colleges and centers. District-wide articulation of the career technical education programs among the district's colleges and centers will be increased and improved, as well as with secondary and other post-secondary institutions. A position at the district level will be able to establish and maintain working linkages and partnerships with industry, secondary education, and community agencies and organizations at the regional and state levels pertaining to the district-wide efforts in all sectors.

The Central/Mother Lode Region strategic plan lists alignment as one of its four major goals. Alignment refers to engaging with industry to align CTE programs with leading and emergent sectors; aligning services across multiple providers, and building partnerships of industry, labor, education, workforce and economic development entities; and aligning efforts to provide comprehensive regional career pathways that align with industry sectors. This proposal provides an executive level district dean position to coordinate college and center programs; lead and coordinate outreach, branding, and marketing; and provide help and support to the colleges in their activities and achievement of their CTE goals. It will also be the district liaison businesses and community organizations, thus achieving the other three goals: increase the amount of CTE instruction delivered, continuously improve CTE outcomes with a particular focus on completion of industry valued credentials, job placement, and wage advancement, and close the equity gaps in program access, completion, and earnings of under-served populations.

"The Business Information Worker ( at 75% of CCCs) and IT Technician Pathway conform to the Guided Pathway design, are vetted statewide by LMI and are completely ready to go..except for marketing. Our new Cohort recruitment and retention plan allows you to hire a team to increase enrollment and retention with a unique community engagement strategy.				","Opportunity
The Business Information Worker Pathway (BIW) defines a sequence of skills essential to entering or advancing in today's business office. Over 200,000 jobs are available throughout California at any one time that match some level of the BIW pathway. It is the most effective pathway for entry level as well as stranded or adult workers looking to refresh their skill sets in a technologically changing world. Numerous placement agencies and Manpower Inc. endorse it.
The Challenge
While many students (approximately 110,000 statewide) are currently enrolled in courses aligned with the pathway, most of them don't know it. Without learning the value to their employment and future of the pathway, and without support for their efforts, these students do not continue and represent part of the 70% of CCC students that are only with the CCCs less than a year. Retaining these students to complete the pathway or to return later for more training will positively affect their future and greatly increase the effective Career Education services of the CCCs.

Additionally, prospective students need to be 'sold' the value of the pathway in order make the necessary commitment to enroll and to finish.

The Solution
The single most effective way to accomplish these results is to focus on regional cohort recruitment and retention for the program at each college. This BIW Recruitment and Retention Guide details how to apply CTE Funding (Strong Workforce, Projects in Common, Guided Pathways) to initiate, manage and eventually create a sustainable community-based cohort support infrastructure.

This project will utilize a three-prong approach to address this sector's workforce needs: 1) develop a water and environmental technologies sector career pathway, 2) create an industry driven regional sustainability plan to provide a long-term labor supply, and 3) build an awareness campaign to encourage the next generations to seek careers within the water sector to resolve the existing training pipeline gap.

"College students gain industry-relevant skills by producing reagents, plates, or other materials using quality assurance and quality control, including documentation, writing/following SOPs, and testing. Products are used in High School Biotech classes. Support available for curriculum development, industry personnel assistance, faculty training/professional development, labels for products that go to High Schools (“Made by Students at _____ College”), and supplies.","Employers have identified quality and regulatory positions as hard to fill throughout the state. Life sciences/biotechnology industries that are regulated by the FDA include food, drugs, medical devices, diagnostics, biologic, and nutritional supplements. The FDA regulates more than $1 trillion of consumer goods or about 25% of consumer expenditures in the United States. This includes $466 billion in food sales, $275 billion in drugs, $60 billion in cosmetics, and $18 billion in vitamin supplements.1

The California Biomedical 2015 Industry Report produced by the California Health Institute (CHI) included a letter from California Governor Jerry Brown stating that, “California leads the nation in the biomedical industry, supporting highly skilled and well-paying jobs in communities across the state.…. Last year, California enacted several laws to strengthen our life sciences community and maintain our competitive position, including AB 93 and SB 90, which made targeted investments in the sector… The State of California is committed to supporting innovation and fostering the biomedical industry.
I look forward to continuing to work with leaders from companies and research institutions throughout the state to find solutions that advance new medical technologies, strengthen our economy and contribute to a healthier society.” 

Data in the 2015 CHI Industry Report supports Governor Brown’s statements and commitment to the growing biomedical industry:
• $101 billion in total revenues
• $27.4 billion in total wages
• $3.8 billion in venture capital investment

In 2013 California’s biomedical industry employed more than 270,000 people, with an average salary of $101,540. California’s biomedical exports in 2013 increased to $22.2 billion from $20.9 billion in 2012. The economic impact of the life sciences goes far beyond the companies that develop drugs, devices and diagnostics. Hundreds of thousands more Californians such as those working in real estate or as patent agents, support the sector. As a result, the Life Sciences Sector is a key factor in sustaining economic growth and manufacturing throughout California.

Workforce Gap: Regulatory and Quality Assurance/Control Professionals
The Life Sciences Industry/Biotechnology Subsectors share a common need: to comply with FDA regulations. These regulations are a set of quality procedures, called collectively GxPs: Good Manufacturing Practices, Good Laboratory Practices, Good 
Clinical Practices, and Good Documentation Practices. GxPs are the essence of quality systems and regulatory practices that are essential to the economic health of the industry. Without a trained core workforce, companies cannot thrive in California.
Regulatory/quality affairs professionals have the GxP skills and knowledge to help companies comply with FDA regulations and those of other accrediting bodies (e.g.,
International Organization for Standardization-ISO). Failure to adequately comply with the complex regulatory and quality standards results in costly recalls and consent decrees that will collapse the infrastructure of a company, not to mention the impact on human health and safety. Managing and ensuring quality is crucial for business integrity. Employees who address quality control (product based) or quality assurance (process based) reduce risk, save costly replacement of goods, and maintain customer satisfaction.

Regulatory/quality affairs professionals come from diverse backgrounds. Although most have earned a Bachelor's Degree in a STEM field, they were not prepared for these jobs in their degree programs. Most earned their positions through years of internal on the job training opportunities. According to Rx Research Services Inc., ""Companies turn to recruiters for hard to fill quality and regulatory positions. They are looking for a mix of on the job experience and a body of regulatory knowledge which is missing in most recent grads. Companies do this because they do not want to risk the fate of their company to an inexperienced team."" As a result, this workforce is extremely hard to find; companies often hire by recruiting or ‘stealing ‘employees from each other. 

Adding to this workforce gap is an evolving regulatory landscape as new technologies come online. For example, in 2011, the federal government enacted into law the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA). The FDA began enforcement of FSMA on Oct. 1, 2015 causing food and nutraceutical/vitamin companies to scramble to build a quality regulatory workforce. As life sciences/biotechnology innovative products evolve, so will the ever expanding regulatory landscape.

The Training Gap: Why It Exists and How It Will Be Addressed
The Life Sciences Sector is experiencing what recruiters call Structural Unemployment, which happens when the skills possessed by the unemployed or underemployed worker do not match the requirements of the job postings. In spite of the clamor for STEM professionals, a close look by the US Census Bureau2, finds that many individuals with STEM degrees are not currently employed in their field of study. In fact, many have trouble finding entry level work. Shockingly, only 14% of bachelor’s degree holders in the biological sciences are working in their field of study. Typically two-year and four-year colleges do not introduce the idea of quality/regulatory careers and have no curriculum or work experience programs to fill this gap.

The reason so many individuals with a STEM background are lacking quality and regulatory knowledge and skills is because most STEM programs are taught from a research perspective, which demonstrates proof of concept, rather than a quality and regulatory perspective, which demonstrates compliance. Most instructors have been trained in a research environment and have never worked in an industry setting or been exposed to quality and regulatory, so they do not think in those terms, and do not teach quality and regulatory to their students. 

Supply Chain Multi-Region Projects in Common addresses this gap in several ways by offering: 
•	Regulatory training for instructors.
•	Opportunities for instructors to do industry externships – experiences in companies where instructors learn about regulatory within the job settings where their students will be working.
•	Curriculum development support to allow instructors to create new regulatory courses or add regulatory modules to existing courses.
•	Workshops and curriculum that instructors can use as a recruiting tool to introduce college and high school students to biotechnology.
•	Opportunities for instructors to design and/or implement courses, modules, or workshops in which the students apply industry-relevant biotech lab skills under regulatory conditions to produce products such as plates, reagents, or slides that will be used by students in other college or high school classes (supply chain).

The Supply Chain Multi-Region Projects in Common is designed to help instructors teach the high-demand industry skills (quality and regulatory) to their students that will help their students get jobs in their field of study and at the same time address the employment gap.

"This project will develop and align guided pathways for the Agriculture, Water, and Environmental Technology sector in the Central Region to provide students with uniform, clear, and specific educational choices. Lead faculty from identified colleges will develop a framework for program pathways, work within their own colleges to refine program recommendations, and re-confer with other colleges to align recommendations. Pathway development will provide clear maps to university transfer programs.","Agriculture, Water and Environmental Technology is a diverse industry sector, with multiple programs in a variety of areas. Students in agriculture-based programs need consistent advising from two-year colleges as they transfer into common 4-year agriculture programs. This project brings discipline faculty together to align program requirements in individual colleges, develop clear advising messaging for students, and design potential program maps that provide students with clear direction. The alignment of agriculture programs in the region will benefit students by providing common program guidelines. The project will ultimately benefit employers and students who select, enter, complete and/or transfer through a pathway.  ",\n,\n,\n

"1) Purchase four instructor laptops to support online instruction and new courses in community settings.
2) Hire two instructional classroom assistants to support instruction in child development lab settings","1) There has been an increased demand for online courses in the area of child development. Many students are unable to attend in-class sections due to issues including childcare and transportation. The Family Home Day Care Provider course was piloted online in 2016-2017 and has been successful (both in enrollment and completion).  This course which articulates for three units of college credit is a model for the development of new offerings and certificate programs. 
In addition to online courses, there has been a growing demand for off-campus classes held in collaboration with potential employers including non profits and the K-12 district. These partnerships would result in a direct pipeline to employment.
2) In keeping with the SWF motto of “more and better,” the program also intends to increase class sizes by adding instructional support. Currently there are numerous courses that are running with lower enrollments due to the logistics of meeting adult and child learning needs simultaneously.   Additional support would allow instructors to spend more time focused on adult instruction (and promoting certificate completion). To pilot this idea, two NANCE instructional assistants are requested for 20 hours each. The goal is to hire child development students from the credit colleges who have a minimum of 12 units and therefore have a foundational knowledge of child development theory and practices. In addition, these students can serve as ambassadors for the colleges, providing information about credit courses, certificates and transfer. 
In terms of regional needs, the San Diego and Imperial County Region has identified adult education as a priority area for 2018-2019. The goal is to not only identify gaps in educational services but to create a seamless transition to employment or to credit institutions. ",\n,\n,\n

Likewise, employers in networking, cybersecurity, and programming require verification of skill to hire employees.  Studies show employment candidates with certifications are 50% more likely to be hired fulltime and receive 10-15% higher wages on average.

"TPP survey, capacity building, organizing  hubs for CCCCO  seed funding began in year 1.  Year 2 : Update survey, regional TPP marketing (developing web presence), model shared certifications, improve LMI/data with Center for Excellence to quantify  teaching and pathway employment needs,  creation of a BACCC TPP community of practice with rotating meetings/webinars, continued TPP counselor training, shared student clubs and activities, shared curriculum and courses, expand outreach to targets. 
"," This project was defined as a Priority Shared Project in Common ( Matthew Roberts, CCCCO) due to the significant teacher shortage in California and the relationship between CTE and CCCCO pathway growth and a prepared, available and quality teaching workforce. Shortages in STEM, CTE, Special Education as well as in the general TK-12 and community college teaching workforce limit the potential of all sectors. Teachers are part of the TK-12 and community college infra-structure.  SF Bay Area regional data shows that the teachers shortages in our region reflect 25% of the total shortages in California ( see data sheet). The high cost of living, high employment and availability of a range of other jobs in the BACCC region exacerbate this shortfall. A regional approach is needed and a scale-up of recruitment, pathways, resources, marketing, counselor training, staff development and shared courses, degrees/programs or certificates for this sector is in order. Additionally, critical sector development work is needed. Better LMI, pathway/jobs, and placement data is needed throughout the region. The Center for Excellence will drill down and assess TOP/SOC codes, regional needs data and employment and job placement which does not currently reflect the pathways accurately in partnership with this RJV.  Without a sector navigator or an accurate description on Launchboard, this sector is disadvantaged. Work from prior years funding which included a survey of the BACCC colleges, counselor training and the formation of a community of practice will continued. 11 colleges applied for Educating Futures funding from the CCCCO. Notification will occur on February 1, 2018 and the RJV will allow for braided funding to those receiving EF funds and supportive funding to those colleges in the region interested in growing TPP but not participating in EF. A survey of 211 school districts in the California School Boards Association’s Delegate Assembly—a sample that generally reflects the demographics of California’s districts—revealed alarming teacher shortage rates. Approximately 75% of districts report having a shortage of qualified teachers for the 2016-17 school year. Over 80% of these districts say that shortages have worsened since the 2013-14 school year and most report not having enough middle and high school teachers— especially in math (58%) and science (57%). This is significant because California continues to face a shortage in qualified STEM/CTE instructors who have the work experience, proficiency in academic subject areas, and pedagogical knowledge to effectively prepare high school and community college students for careers. With 32 trade and technical schools and 28 community colleges offering CTE programs in the San Francisco Bay Area alone, the need for well-prepared CTE teachers in this region is enormous. To meet the workforce needs of the science- and technology-focused economy of the San Francisco Bay Area, most CTE programs have a foundation in math and science. Therefore, it is critical that CTE teacher preparation efforts include a commitment to increasing the pool of qualified STEM teachers at the secondary and community college level. The current teacher shortage in California is severe, chronic, and relentless. The high cost of living combined with the abundance of well-paying technology and STEM jobs has made the San Francisco teaching shortage, at all levels, significant. Currently, 29% of the 41 open faculty positions at CCSF are in STEM or STEM-based CTE programs. This is also true for other Bay Region community colleges but our own districts need to be surveyed and the community college teacher shortage in the BACCC region needs to be quantified. this data work is essential. There is also a need for a more diverse teaching workforce. This is an equity issue as students seek role models and teachers reflecting their own backgrounds as they complete TK-12 education. Fast forward to college and less than 8% of Latinx and African American students enter CCSF with college-level proficiency in English and math. While poverty is the most significant indicator in school failure, poverty and inequitable educational opportunities are linked. Teacher turnover is higher in low-performing schools with poor children in attendance and newer teachers are often placed in the hardest to serve schools. 
Without ensuring that new teachers are committed to the communities that they serve and prepared to serve the children attending all schools, especially schools serving primarily Latinx and African American students, we will continue to see a less diverse STEM landscape and black and brown students without access to the highest wage jobs in the highest growth sectors. Our region will continue to see uneven college success and segregated STEM and CTE pathways in critical sectors.  “There were nearly 8.6 million STEM jobs in May 2015, representing 6.2% of U.S. employment.” Additionally, significant funding has been made available to 4 year colleges and credential programs since 2014 to address the teacher shortfall in CA. Unfortunately a critical component of the pathway  was overlooked, as funds were not made available to community colleges as project leads by either the Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CTC) or higher education partners for teacher recruitment and support. This omission continues to be a critical oversight, as over 54% of new California teacher credential recipients attended a California Community College, and in San Francisco, an average of 40% of those credentialed at SFSU in academic years 2009-10 transferred from CCSF.  Being able to track our community college transfer students through credential is an important element of this work and our BACCC members need better articulation and data agreements with the 5 CSU's in the region and the credential programs. Early opportunities to engage in related employment and a course of study are linked to developing high quality teachers and the opportunity to engage students in college classes and field experiences in teaching environments presents itself at the Community College level, prior to transfer. The continued focus on four-year institutions and credential programs discounts and overlooks the importance of career exploration engaged in by California’s community college students. 
Regional partners in the Educating Futures Initiative include: City College of San Francisco, Cabrillo, Hartnell, Canada, Gavilan, Skyline, Napa, Berkeley, Los Medanos, West Valley
Project Leads: Kathleen White, CCSF and Mary Soltis, Cabrillo College ( current CCCO TPP grant recipients)

"Irvine Valley College has fewer Career Technical Education programs than other colleges in Orange County. There are many opportunities to expand and improve current programs and build crucial new ones. This Local Plan proposes to build a much-needed infrastructure for IVC’s CTE success to the measurable benefit of students, faculty and employers.  Building on the success of our Science Technology Engineering and Math (STEM) programs we will support cutting-edge CTE programs.","Irvine Valley College is a small college relative to the other 8 community colleges in the Orange County area.  With the exception of business programs at IVC, CTE has a small presence in and around the community.  The intent of the funding is to strengthen and build upon the existing programs in Science, Engineering Technology and Math (STEM) as biomedical, engineering, and automation are plentiful in our service area and reflect the future today.  

Perkins funding is limited at IVC though the college has made great strides to boost CTE programs with the investment of Biotech, Mechatronics, and Photonics.  All IVC applicants must demonstrate how the project will result in increased graduation rates, stronger connections to industry, closing the skills gap, and/or employment.  Emphasis will be on program revisions and the development of new programs with industry support.  

The funds will used to support the development and build-out of a building automation program.  With the support of industry partners, the college and district funds will be used to purchase equipment and build-out the infrastructure to serve as a demonstration training center for the region.  The college will leverage funds with the regional sector and deputy sector navigator in energy, utility and construction.  

Funding will also be used to support and grow the CTE and EWD operational infrastructure.  Investing in people to ensure the college meets the SWP metrics will be important.  Additionally, ensuring students have access to jobs, internships and career services by hiring additional staff and students will be a necessary driver for SWP success.  Supporting the Irvine Valley College foundation by hiring an individual to track students leaving IVC will assist the college in reporting up-to-date and just in time data as well as provide access to students working, transferring or both.  

Funding will support faculty and administrator professional development in CTE and EWD.  On-going support for administrator's to train, re-train and seek knowledge.

The following are key elements associated with round 2 of local SWP funds:
(A) Focus training efforts on re-training the workforce.
(B) Increase the number of quality career technical education courses, programs, and pathways that lead to successful workforce outcomes, as well as invest in new or emerging career technical education courses, programs, and pathways that may become operative in subsequent years.
(C) Develop a career center for students to seek, explore and have success in obtaining internships, jobs and other meaningful work related experiences.  
(D) Build the CTE infrastructure by hiring additional faculty and staff necessary to meet the goals and objectives established through the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA)
(E)  Work with Student Services to support wrap-around services as well as the development of individual career plans.
(F) Continue to work with the district and college to implement degree audit thereby increasing the graduation and completion rates.
(G) Use funding to support dual enrollment throughout the IVC service area.

"SWP funds will be used to upgrade our existing welding facilities resulting in a doubling of the size of our electric welding lab from 12 to 24 stations.  The increased number of stations will lead to more time on task for each student, doubling the time they currently have available with the equipment.  The increased time on task has shown in the past to have a marked difference in the skill quality of students.","For the Cerro Coso Community College service area, to meet the goals of more and better CTE for onground programs, we need to focus on the better for many of our programs because we serve a small population over a large geographic area (17,000 sq miles).  In our welding program we were able several years ago under the C6 grant to expand and modernize our gas welding lab, we saw an immediate improvement in the quality of work product from the students in those classes.  This was directly attributable to the additional time on task each student was able to have with the additional lab stations.  In addition to the increase in the number of lab stations, we need to modernize the equipment so that we stay current with industry standards to allow students to have the appropriate training on the appropriate equipment when the move into industry.",\n,\n,\n

"Enhance Architecture Dept. by developing new, stackable Digital Design/Fabrication courses and finalize the creation of our dedicated model-making and computer workstation space in Studio G241.","Students in any Architecture program need access to state of the art equipment such as laser cutters and 3D printers (both inside and outside of class times). Having this type of equipment readily available within the dept. will increase access and availability specifically for our students, and improve overall student success. The on-campus Fablab is great and does help but often it hinders their successful completion of a project due to the limited use when others outside our dept. are using equipment. Having the ability to acquire this equipment in conjunction with previous Round 1 equipment (currently ordered) will help us ensure that our dept. will have a dedicated model-making/lab/workspace and one that will be used specifically by our students (much like other depts.. that have tools and equipment specific to their student’s needs and use). Students will still be able to make use of the Fablab as well – especially when deadlines near and a backlog develops with our limited in-house equipment - not an uncommon occurrence when deadlines near.

"Program improvements include replacing out of date equipment, instructional assistants to increase student success and provide more opportunities to repair micropipettes for highschool partners and give work experience to our own students.","Need and response 1: Replace out-of-date protein purification instrument with an industry-standard Bio-Rad NGC 10 medium pressure chromatography system. Our current equipment limits our ability to teach students the principles of chromatography because it lacks features that are used by industry to properly purify protein products of cells. Furthermore, Solano Community College, where many of our students hope to transfer to get their B.S. in biomanufacturing, is using an NGC system. This equipment will allow us to teach chromatography in a way that prepares students for furthering their education at Solano, as well as jobs in industry. 
The Biomanufacturing program has not had a large equipment purchase for several years, although we have used equipment monies to replace small equipment and repair heavily used equipment. 
Need and response 2: Increase student success – we need instructional aides in the lab classroom to assist during the lab time, and act as tutors for students while they work on the lab exercises.  Increased contact with instructors and instructional aides increases student retention and success. Instructional aides benefit from the reinforcement of their knowledge by explaining it to others, as well as gaining work experience in a laboratory setting.  
Need and response 3:  Micropipettors are a critical small piece of equipment used for accurate measurements in DNA and protein labs.  Due to heavy use they often need repair and recalibration.  Biomanufacturing students at Laney college work no micropipettors  brought to Laney by BABEC from local highschools.  Students gain experience by repairing the micropipettors,  In addition this builds relationships with local highschools and not only supports their biotech programs, but will also lead to increased enrollments as more students are aware of the possibilities of jobs in biotechnology/biomanufacturing.

"We have multiple projects that need to be addressed with these few funds: Marketing, instructional equipment improvement and Program Coordination Assistance.","Marketing: We desperately need marketing to increase our brand visibility, among both prospective students and employers. Recently, some major local culinary schools closed, resulting in a large pool of displaced students. Paradoxically, our enrollment did not increase. Our research confirms that the primary reason is lack of public awareness about our program. Our program has no advertising budget. Hence, it has no market presence. The funds allocated to marketing would help us address this issue and increase enrollment.
Instructional Equipment Improvement: We have several pieces of critical equipment that need to be upgraded, in order to maintain our state mandated code compliance and academic/industry currency. Please note that, except where otherwise specified, all items also need funds allocated for installation. 

We have identified the following needed upgrades: 
A new automated dishwasher in the Bakery kitchen. The internal mechanisms and installation components are completely rusted, and it poses health and safety hazard for both students and faculty. 
Doughnut fryer for the Bakery kitchen. This piece of equipment is needed for all manner of fried pastry products, from doughnuts to beignets, meat pies, empanadas, canoli, internal elements of recipes, etc . . . 
Additional and replacement double deep fryers for the Bistro kitchen. The kitchen's current unit is over 8 years old, which is beyond its recommended ""use"" span. 
2 reach-in refrigerators, to replace the current units on the main cooking line. Like the deep fryer, these units are quite old, have been intensively used but not maintained. Consequently, their doors no longer close properly, and even when the doors are ""held"" close they no longer hold a constant and even temperature (icing and/or overheating). 6 Robot-Coups: we do not have enough units to serve student and staff production requirements.

2 meat slicers: we are currently sharing two 6+ year-old units between 3 kitchens. 
3 standing mixers: these additional units are needed to accommodate student and staff production requirements.
6 Vending Machines: we are responsible for feeding the campus. Historically and currently, we have been unable to provide food in the late afternoon and evening hours (after conclusion of labs). With vending machines, students will be able to produce and packaged food from lab for purchase by students and staff in the Student Center Cafeteria at times that are convenient for THEM!

Santiago Canyon, Santa Ana, Fullerton and Irvine Valley College met with a biotechnology advisory committee in June 2012 which recommended developing a stackable certificate that would provide new students and incumbent workers with skills to enter and advance in this growing industry. Since that meeting, the four colleges have developed and implemented certificates and degrees in biotechnology.  The certificate is comprised of courses intended to develop and ensure proficiency in specific lab-based skills as well as more traditional basic biology and chemistry courses.  

 

The program integrated existing courses and programs (e.g. biology and chemistry) with the biotechnology program to support the industry needs and provide students with multiple opportunities.  The benefit of the biotech degree and certificate programs allow students to complete a certificate to obtain good-wage employment and may later use the completed coursework in biology and chemistry to complete a pathway to transfer to a University in a STEM major. Similarly, a biology major may decide to take the biotechnology-specific skills courses in order to obtain employment in the field of interest while simultaneously pursuing their degree.

 

According to the Orange County Workforce Development Board…Emerging Cluster-Biotechnology/Nanotechnology¤ | A future employment cluster which will produce discoveries in biology and technology and mix the two to create new products, services and industries to enhance healthcare and biological care. While pharmaceuticals and medical device manufacturing are two components of this industry, discoveries from the human genome project, nanotechnology, and advances in biological knowledge promise the emergence of fields that can only be imagined now.

 

All the colleges are asking for instructional support to ensure consistency and continuity as we build momentum with the high schools, colleges and industry.  The funds will support lab technicians, non-apportionment generating courses, dual enrollment, books for the high school campuses, a full-time internship coordinator as well as provide the oversight and leadership for the Orange County Biotech Initiative.


Addressing Regional Needs by expanding the colleges coordination efforts to align initiatives.

"This Multi-sector Regional Automation Pathways Project creates an initiative that addresses employers’ needs for a highly trained Automation workforce.  Labor market demand is strong.  The project addresses estimated demand of 3,200 job openings annually in the LAOC region, with median hourly earnings ranging from $19 to $37.  Supply/Demand in Orange County is 583 annual completers versus a demand of 846.  ","Economic and labor market research are the primary drivers for this project:
?	Annual demand for the target occupations in Orange County is 846 versus 583 completers
?	New competencies are needed in all target occupations to accommodate industry trends in Building Automation and industrial Automation
?	Policies and incentives arising from California’s clean energy and pollution reduction mandates continue to accelerate industry’s evolution to automated solutions
?	Policies and incentives for adoption of  Industrial Automation systems are at the core of California’s strategy for economic growth and competitiveness in the global market

Legislation such as Proposition 39 continues to create new jobs by infusing hundreds of millions of dollars annually in energy efficient buildings and by incentivizing new private investments. New technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Direct Digital Control, Smart Sensors, Analytical Engines, and Artificial Intelligence dominate the way buildings and processes must respond to these drivers.  The Orange County workforce is not well prepared to support this level of investment or the sophistication of new Automation technologies.  In addition to the supply/demand and new worker competency gaps, multiple studies show a massive need to upskill the incumbent workforce. 

Orange County colleges have a significant portfolio of programs related to Automation, and a number of mechanical and electrical career pathways, most of which need to be upgraded to address new competencies in Automation.  This region offers an ideal platform to develop strategies, best practices, and evidence that can be replicated and scaled across the state.

The Automation Pathways project has evolved through inputs from faculty and Deans across the region. Colleges that will benefit most from this initiative offer programs in Process Control, HVACR, Water/Wastewater,  Building Automation, Industrial Automation, Robotics, Data Analytics, and Cybersecurity.  

At the project’s core is an “Expert Network” in Orange County that cultivates credit transferability and stackable credentials across multiple colleges.  The primary purpose of the Expert Network is facilitate collaboration and experimentation to advance student success in Automation disciplines.  Engaging faculty with major Automation systems manufacturers and professional services firms, this Network develops common student learning outcomes that are aligned with competencies in greatest demand by industry.   A focus on “employability by design” creates relationships between employers and colleges for work-based learning and employment of completers.  These same relationships help faculty infuse industry workforce standards into curriculum that enhance marketability of students from participating colleges, and provide a basis for lifelong learning through continuing education.

Recognizing existing demands on faculty, this project assist in curriculum alignment and development by funding consultants to work at the direction of faculty.  It also provides funding for adjunct instructors to deliver specialized Automation modules that are infused into existing courses and programs.

Orange County’s Expert Network is the primary focus of an existing statewide industry advisory comprised of the the Association of Controls Professionals, Siemens, Johnson Controls, Honeywell, Lutron, Cisco, and others with a strong presence in the county.   Significant contributions to this advisory are being made by UC Irvine and the National Science Foundation BEST Center.

This initiative includes: 
?	Alignment of student learning outcomes across the region’s programs
?	Transfer of certificate or degree-level credits across participating colleges
?	Convening and sustaining an Expert Network that engages industry in faculty planning
?	Professional development for faculty, aligned with industry priorities
?	A community of practice for sharing curricula and building evidence for replication and scaling
?	Engagement of consultants to support faculty in curriculum alignment and development
?	Leveraging NSF and US Department of Energy Automation initiatives
?	Investment in equipment 
?	Assessment of outcomes and continuous improvement of Network processes

Collaboration among the colleges will define a three-year career pathway development strategy and implement the first year’s plan. 

Potential Beneficiaries of Multi-regional Automation Career Pathways:
 
Program	Orange County Colleges
HVAC / Energy Systems	Cypress	Orange Coast
Process Control	Fullerton	 
Data Analytics	Golden West	 
Water Distribution Management	Santiago Canyon	 
Mechatronics	IVC	 
Robotics	Santiago Canyon	Orange Coast
Cybersecurity	Coastline	


In summary, Automation Pathways addresses strong employment opportunities via a regional approach that enhances the programs of participating colleges.  Its structure of stackable credentials, transferable skills, and alignment with industry workforce standards create important new possibilities for students’ continuing education and social mobility.  With 35,000 students enrolled in the target TOP Codes plus the engagement of major employers, Automation Pathways creates a significant “push/pull” effect that benefits students: 

Push:   Among the 5,000 enrolled students, awareness of Automation Pathways can motivate increasing numbers to complete their degree or certificate in response to the allure of leading edge technology, strong employment opportunities, income potential, and transferable skills.

Pull:  As employers become increasingly aware of Automation Pathways, their engagement with the colleges will increase in developing talent pipelines that recruit college students and provide continuing education for incumbent workers.

This Initiative is led by the Energy, Construction and Utilities Sector Navigator and the Regional Deputy Sector Navigator as a continuation of the Energy and Sustainability Projects funded under Strong Workforce Program Round 1.0.

"With the first allocation of Strong Workforce funding, the Technical Education Division was able to offer counseling specifically targeted for students in all of the division’s programs. This proposal is to evaluate the effectiveness of the first year, refocus and refine efforts as needed, and continue to improve the services provided to Tech Ed students. One specific goal is to increase the number of comprehensive education plans developed for students, an effective and powerful tool. ","With the first allocation of Strong Workforce funding, the Technical Education Division was able to offer counseling that was specifically targeted for students in all of the division’s programs. With supplemental funding, one full-time counselor (with some coordination time) and two adjuncts were housed in the division office building, and able to offer their expertise in the requirements to help Tech Ed students define their goals and streamline their progress. The logistics of the process were challenging and are still being addressed, but the program was welcomed and supported by students and faculty alike as being long overdue. 

This proposal is to evaluate the effectiveness of the first year, refocus and refine efforts as needed, and continue to improve the services provided to Tech Ed students. One specific goal is to increase the number of comprehensive education plans developed for students, an effective and powerful tool. With continued funding, the Technical Education Division hopes to develop this program-specific counseling system to become the counseling model for the college-wide effort toward guided pathways, particularly in strong specialty programs. 

The Technical Education Division includes Automotive Technology, Design Technology, Electronics Technology, Horticulture, and Welding Technology programs on the main ARC campus, Automotive Collision Technology and Diesel/Clean Diesel Technology at a Mather site, and Pre-Apprenticeship and Electrician Trainee programs at a Twin Rivers site. These are distinct, complex programs with generally strong employer demand. Few (8%) of our students are enrolled full time. 

For many years it has been both the Tech Ed student and faculty perception that there are few general counselors who understand both the value, challenges and critical details of Tech Ed programs. Anecdotal stories abound of students receiving of misleading or incorrect program information from general counselors. To address that information and support gap, the Technical Education faculty and administration felt that having counselors familiar with division programs housed in the area would benefit all students and increase their persistence and success.

For the first round of Strong Workforce programs, the division requested and received funding to introduce and house Tech Ed-specific counselors. This started in the summer of 2017, with one full-time and two adjunct counselors available to meet with students four days and evenings each week in and office in the Tech Ed faculty offices building. The presence of the counselors in the area has been welcomed by students and faculty alike, and is beginning to gain traction. The logistics of rolling out the project, however, has come with challenges. Making appointments is still not a smooth process. The counselors’ outreach to the classes to let students know the services available has been limited. And the initial services were more focused on doing GPSs for students rather than comprehensive education plans. Planned follow up with students has been uneven. But the program has already had an impact and the potential for continued success is huge.

Based on those challenges and observations of the outcomes so far, the Technical Education Division proposes to both continue and simultaneously improve the program. During Spring 2018, the Tech Ed Counselors and the Deans of Counseling and Technical education will assess what has been accomplished through Fall 2017, determine what worked and what could be improved, and then propose and implement modifications for the future that are tied into specific outcomes. The goals will include refining classroom outreach with counselor presentations, focusing on comprehensive education plans, improving the appointment process, and exploring best practices of similar programs throughout the state. The plan is to modify and roll out improved services as soon as possible during the Spring 2018 term, while continuing to analyze and improve services going forward. 

With an improved process and clear goals counselors will be able to increase the number of student contact hours, increase the number of comprehensive education plans, increase the number of classroom presentations, all with the goal of increasing persistence and meeting student academic goals. 

The request is for funding 1.0 FTE adjunct counselors for Spring-Summer 2018, and for a 1.0 FTE full-time counselor for Fall 2018; student help to support the counseling effort, and funding for professional development for the counselors to extend their knowledge and understanding of Technical Education programs as well as Career Education in general and other relevant information, i.e. dual enrollment, etc.

We expect that all students in the Technical Education Division will benefit from having in-house, easily-accessible counselors, but disproportionately-impacted students in particular stand to gain the most. In addition to creating comprehensive education plans, Tech Ed counselors will help support students by providing guidance about academic and program issues, financial aid, work-life-school balance, relevant social services, campus student support services including WAC and RAD, internship and employment opportunities, financial aid, scholarships, etc., all of which will improve their persistence and the opportunity for successful completion of their goals.",\n,\n,\n

"This project will provide FTE required to offer Dual Enrollment classes in Career Technical Education.  ","AB 288 was signed into law by Governor Brown in 2015 and took effect on January 1, 2016.  The intent of AB 288 was “for the purpose of offering or expanding dual enrollment opportunities for students who may not already be college-bound or who are underrepresented in higher education, with the goal of developing seamless pathways from high school to community college for career technical education or preparation for transfer, improving high school graduation rates, or helping high school pupils achieve college and career readiness.”  

In the Los Rios District, Policies and Regulations for Dual Enrollment were approved by the Board of Trustees in January 2017.  During Fall 2017, American River College became the first College in the District to offer Dual Enrollment classes, developing a partnership with Highlands High School to start a Diesel Technology Program.

This project will continue to expand enrollment in Diesel Technology, Automotive Technology, and Design Technology through Dual Enrollment.

"In 2017 WestEd analyzed the region’s current status in career pathways and employment readiness and recommended developing Guided Career Pathways. The SDIC region will undertake six implementation activities: (1) staff a leadership structure; (2) professional development for participating faculty and staff; (3) comprehensive pathways mapping; (4) coordinated student engagement, intake and advising; (5) employer engagement; and (6) employment readiness and job development tools and services. ","Regional needs: Employers have difficulty filling jobs due to a lack of qualified applicants. Employers report that students do not have the needed job readiness skills or soft skills. These skills can include adaptive, analysis/solution mindset, collaboration, communication, digital fluency, an entrepreneurial mindset, empathy, resilience, self-awareness, and social/diversity awareness. 

There is no regional articulation of Career Education (CE) courses and programs, although there is articulation across some high school and community college partners. The San Diego/Imperial region has developed some career pathways through the SB 1070 CE Regional Pathways work and through two CCPT grants working to develop career pathways in specific sectors. However, not all programs offer work-based learning or integrate work readiness into the coursework. Students get different levels of access to programs across the region, depending on where they live. Because there is considerable student mobility around the region, it is critical that students have portable credentials and courses so that they can continue on their pathway if they have to change schools.

Each college has its own career services system, which is usually isolated from course content, educational planning and CE leadership. Many community college students do not access career planning and guidance services until they are close to leaving the institution, whether by graduation or by deciding to leave to pursue work. Each college in the region offers some career services which may include career exploration materials and counselors available to students who make their way to the office to seek assistance. Colleges may offer in-person individual and group counseling, and offer a series of job fairs and workshops each semester on career exploration and related topics. In addition, most colleges provide access to online career exploration information and materials on their websites, and online workshops on a range of topics. 

In many majors, students must initiate career planning; it is not always integrated into their CE coursework. Most community college career services require the student to initiate the job search, rather than having career exploration and workplace skills development integrated into the institution's CE courses and ongoing student planning and information systems. Because many students attend more than one institution, students need to be able to transport their career and educational plans among the region's colleges.

Although most colleges also offer links to internship search sites, there is no central site for internships and job placement; employers may be contacted by many different people from across the region looking for placements. Although the career center and CE programs may have leads on some local internship opportunities, the student is often left to find the actual internship on their own. 

In 2017 the SDIC Consortium contracted with WestEd to research and analyze the current status of career pathways and employment readiness in the region. Their research and analysis revealed that while students are persisting in individual courses, they are not completing full pathways within their selected career area. Only 34 percent enroll in aligned course in subsequent terms, and 13 percent remain within the pathway across any of the colleges within the SDIC region. WestEd noted that the populations of San Diego and Imperial Counties and their community college students have pressing needs for robust, differentiated instructional and support services to ensure student persistence and long-term success:
•	Over one-third of the population in the region lives at or near poverty levels.
•	34 percent of the population over 25 (over 750,000 adults) holds a high school diploma or less.
•	46 percent of community college students are over the age of 25; 32 percent are between the ages of 20-24; and 22 percent are age 19 or less. This youngest group appears to be growing.
•	Approximately 38 percent of students in the region are “first generation” college students.
•	Across the ten colleges, 5 to 38 percent of students took one or more credit or noncredit ESL courses.

Approach to address needs. WestEd noted that the “Guided Pathways” approach can help support student success and equitable outcomes — whether certificates, employment, or transfer — by providing structured course sequences, careful intake and planning processes, rich learning opportunities, and robust support services. At the core of this approach is fundamental reconfiguration of the college experience that focuses on student needs and provides “intrusive” or proactive direction that guides students to completion and success. Three regional colleges are currently working with the California Guided Pathways project to develop guided pathways. 

There are four pillars in the guided pathways approach: clarify the path; enter the path; stay on the path; ensure learning. WestEd recommended adding a fifth pillar – employment preparation and transitions – to create Guided Career Pathways.  Rather than working with a subset of students, Guided Pathways is a collegewide undertaking that provides a framework for integrating all of the California-based initiatives. Regional approaches, especially for business engagement processes, can enhance alignment of the Guided Pathways approach with Strong Workforce goals. 

Through their research WestEd identified several key system components as critical for student success in college, employment, further education, and long-term careers. These components are closely aligned with those supported by the Guided Pathways initiative, with additional emphasis on career-related experiences and employment services. The key system components include:

•	Pre-enrollment engagement: activities conducted prior to matriculation with prospective students to facilitate enrollment, and aid in their understanding of the educational options, pathways, and services available. 

•	Matriculation and comprehensive assessment: the process of enrolling in a community college and completing the necessary assessments and plans to pursue a pathway. 

•	Career exploration: a process of learning about career options through workshops, classes, tours, career-related research projects, informational interviews, and job shadows, based on identified interests and goals.

•	Career planning: development of a career plan, which includes a student’s interests, skills, and values, the career options that the student is interested in pursuing, and the educational and work-related experiences that will lead to one or more long-term career goals. 

•	Education planning: development of an education plan, which includes the documentation of the courses needed for a student to complete a specific degree, certificate, or transfer program of study and fulfill their educational goals, both at the community college level and beyond.

•	Pathway participation and career preparation: engagement with the courses and experiences offered in a career pathway. 

•	Applied and work-based learning (WBL): strategies that deepen learning and support career awareness, career exploration, and career preparation through engagement with employers and real work opportunities. 

•	Student supports: the full range of services needed to successfully complete pathways including tutoring, testing for special education, peer study groups, assessment and accessibility supports for students with disabilities, and nonacademic supports for personal needs such as just-in-time housing services, transportation and parking, food and nutrition, child care, financial assistance, and other subsidies. 

•	Employment preparation and transition: activities that prepare students to transition into further education, formal training, and/or the workforce such as resume writing, interview skills, job search services, letters of recommendation, and feedback and coaching opportunities.

WestEd made several overarching recommendations, including:

1.	Develop a regional approach to career preparation that builds coherence across all ten colleges for both students and employers.

2.	Integrate career preparation into instruction and student support delivered throughout the students’ college experience, from first entry through transfer and employment.

3.	Align institutional and program-level student learning outcomes to reflect a focus on career preparation for all students.

4.	Make career-related services and tools — including tools for career planning, career exploration, internships, and job placement — readily accessible to all students.

5.	Expand the scope of the learning environment to include workplaces and communities, positioning work-based learning as integral to career preparation and student success.

6.	Employ technology supported by adequate staffing to engage all students in comprehensive career planning and career preparation activities, keep them engaged, and monitor their success.

7.	Provide all students with a comprehensive and articulated set of tools, information, and resources to successfully navigate their college experience from pre-enrollment to employment.

WestEd provided more specific recommendations for each of the five pillars of the Guided Career Pathways. A copy of their report is available upon request. 

To address these detailed recommendations, in Round 2 the SDIC region will undertake six main activities:

1.	Establish a guided pathways development leadership structure with staffing.

2.	Provide professional development for participating faculty and staff

3.	Develop guided pathways, with comprehensive pathways mapping as a critical first step

4.	Develop coordinated student engagement, intake and advising capacity

5.	Engage employers in partnerships to develop and implement the fifth pillar of guided career pathways

6.	Pilot implementation of employment readiness and job developm",\n,\n,\n

OC Center of Excellence
Establish an Orange County COE to concentrate solely on working with OC colleges on their various LMI needs, including TOP code alignment projects, gap analyses on emerging and/or priority sectors and occupations, and SWP strategic regional and local planning. ","OC Strong Workforce Regional Research Analyst

As Orange County engages in additional projects in Round 2 of the Strong Workforce Program (SWP), it will be critical to gather data on how the various regional projects are impacting or moving the SWP metrics.  Through the services of a regional SWP Regional Research Analyst, the region can benefit via the development of regular reporting on metrics, and ongoing recommendations based on regional statistical information; these regional statistical analysis and reports should inform not only current investments, but also future SWP investments.

The Orange County region is set to receive close to $9M dollars annually through its Strong Workforce Program (SWP) regional allocation; these funds are distributed throughout the region via a regional planning process, where colleges submit regional projects that seek to address labor market needs in priority and emergent industry sectors.  Unlike other sources of funding, SWP has some expected metrics, many of them aligned with WIOA, for which colleges are now responsible; these metrics include increased enrollment, student progress and completion, and employment.  Selected regional projects must have an impact on the metrics (i.e. lead to increased enrollment), but it is difficult to quantify whether that impact can be attributed to a specific project; in addition, although regions are supposed to rely on the LaunchBoard system to collect outcome data, the system is at least a year or two behind, thus it cannot be used to properly plan for future funding years.  This issue or need can be addressed through the services provided by a Regional Research Analyst, who could assist in collecting, analyzing and preparing statistical information from multiple research department throughout the region, which can then be used for decision making and proper planning; these information would be up-to-date and would validate some of the information within LaunchBoard for the OC region.

OC Center of Excellence

The Orange County region used to have a Center of Excellence (COE) Director, who was assigned to work with OC colleges on workforce research studies, comprehensive labor market gap analysis studies, and other regional duties; the position was consolidated to just one director, instead of 2 for LA and 1 for OC, who is supposed to serve the 29 colleges in the region.  Through the services of an OC COE, the region can benefit by having a dedicated person who can concentrate solely on working with OC colleges on their various LMI needs, including TOP code alignment projects, gap analysis on emerging and/or priority sectors and occupations, and SWP strategic regional and local planning.

The LAOCRC is the largest Regional Consortia, in terms of CTE FTEs, out of the seven Consortia in the state; the combined region is indeed a key driver in the Chancellor’s Office efforts of “More and Better” CTE; however, the Chancellor’s Office has recognized the region as two separate sub-regions, and thus the LAOCRC is the only Consortia in the state to submit separate SWP plans, one for LA and one for OC, which also involves separate budget allocations.  The OC Region has to undergo yearly regional SWP planning, which requires having a dedicated Center of Excellence that can assist the region to properly and strategically plan where regional and local investments can have the greatest impact.  In addition, while other regions similar in size to Orange County, such as the Inland Empire and San Diego, have dedicated COEs, the combined LA and OC regions have only one COE to serve both regions; as mentioned previously, the combined region use to have 3 dedicated COEs.",\n,\n,\n

Solution to problem: increase the number of graduates to meet the supply-demand gap by providing real-world work experience technical and soft skills.
How:
1). Provide students with hands-on experience that develops manufacturing operations, quality and regulations, and employment-readiness skills. 
2) Student manufactured products will be used in high school classrooms throughout the bay area. The use of manufactured products by customers gives further incentive and value for students to make ""the best product."" 
3) The products will serve as way to market our programs to high schools and recruit new students to our programs. For example, videos of how college students are making the products will be on a website to promote the hands-on work done by the students.
4) The project will also serve to promote various career pathways found in industry.

This project helps develop a life science career pathway for high school and college students. The project relies on industry commitment for advice, faculty training, and audits. It will provide real, hands-on work-based experience for all students in the class by allowing students to experience and explore different functions of a company operation (wear different hats) such as calibration, marketing, manufacturing, quality control, packaging and labelling while practicing their analytical and soft skills.

"CCW’s mission is to deploy a powerful research program, convene regional industry advisory councils & build strong business intermediary systems that collectively will: 1)support data-based, industry validated CTE programs, aligned to the economic needs in our region; 2)knowledgably and proficiently educate and connect students to the skilled labor force; 3)connect colleges to regional businesses to facilitate increased workbased learning, faculty professional development, and student employment","Although managed by Santa Monica College, The Center for a Competitive Workforce (CCW) is intended as a partnership between all the colleges that comprise the Los Angeles/Orange County Regional Consortium (LAOCRC) and the Center of Excellence at Mt. San Antonio College (COE) with key local business leadership organizations including the Southern California Leadership Council (SCLC), the LA Area Chamber of Commerce (LA Chamber) and the Los Angeles Economic Development Corp (LAEDC). 

The Los Angeles/ Orange County regional economy, an almost one trillion dollar tapestry of industrial diversity, riches and opportunity amid wrenching poverty, is being inexorably pulled into the information age, presenting more of its residents with both the promise of economic success and the peril of being further left behind. The economic future we see today is quite different than the future we envisioned only a few decades ago. In particular, we are in the midst of a structural transition where information technologies, artificial intelligence, machine learning, virtual reality, and ever more powerful computers are changing the nature of work, the need for labor, the organization of firms, and the rewards that work now earns. Without direct and targeted intervention on our parts, as education, economic development and career technical education (CTE) purveyors, there will be neither enough middle skill, middle class jobs nor enough skilled human capital to sustain our regional economy. The region’s future economic success depends upon a stronger, better informed and more durable collaboration between regional workforce and education institutions and systems, industry firms and economic developers, who will each face an entirely new set and scale of challenges which will demand a synergistic approach. Together we must confront the following challenges:    1) What are the economic, technological and globalization forces that are shaping the future industrial makeup and associated labor markets of the region? What are the implications of these future trends to middle skill job opportunities and allied training in the region?        2) How does the region ensure that more of its residents have the ability and accessibility to participate in the particular region’s future success and prosperity? What programs are needed to ease the transition for those who are at risk of being left behind?          3)  How does the region better prepare its local supply of labor for the innovation-intensive industries of tomorrow and more successfully connect this surplus supply of labor transitioning out of the region’s production-based economy?      Leveraging the aspirations and the resources of the Strong Workforce Program, we can forge a powerful new regional partnership to confront these challenges. Hence the vision behind our new Center for a Competitive Workforce.

Twenty-nine camps at twenty host colleges are proposed.","""There is a critical need to ensure that the State of California is able to hire, retain, and promote qualified and well prepared Cybersecurity professionals given the dynamic change in scope and breadth of threats in the contemporary cyber security and defense environment."", Keith E. Clement, Ph.D, Chair, Workforce Development and Education Subcommittee, State of California Cybersecurity Task Force Workforce Development and Education Subcommittee, Framework for Recommendations for a California Cybersecurity Pathway of Education and Workforce.

There is a shortage of prepared cybersecurity professionals is estimated at 350k-400k nationally and 45,000 across the state.  There is a lacking coordinated workforce development and strategy/policy on how we are to educate, train, and prepare the cybersecurity workforce of today and tomorrow.  There is a critical need for cybersecurity education and professional training spanning California education from K-12 through post-secondary education.  

The ""Cybersecurity - Summer 2018 CyberCamp project is one component of building cybersecurity competencies early.  Students, as early as middle school, can begin to develop those skills by participating in the camps and forming Cyberpatriot teams at their schools during the school year.

CyberPatriot is the National Youth Cyber Education Program.  ???CyberPatriot was created by the Air Force Association (AFA) to inspire K-12 students toward careers in cybersecurity or other science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines critical to our nation's future. 

At the center of CyberPatriot is the National Youth Cyber Defense Competition. The competition puts teams of high school and middle school students in the position of newly hired IT professionals tasked with managing the network of a small company. In the rounds of competition, teams are given a set of virtual images that represent operating systems and are tasked with finding cybersecurity vulnerabilities within the images and hardening the system while maintaining critical services in a six hour period.  

To help students prepare for the competition the AFA has instituted summer CyberCamps.  AFA CyberCamps emphasize fun, hands-on learning of cybersecurity principles that are relevant and applicable to everyday life. At CyberCamp, students learn the importance of cyber safety and how to protect their personal devices and information from outside threats.

The Governor has proposed adding $200M to the Strong Workforce Program “to encourage the establishment and support of K-12 CTE programs that are aligned with needed industry skills.” The CyberCamps might be eligible for funding from that source in future years. It is worth considering whether that funding source could fund a range of career-oriented summer camps for K-12 students on college campuses that more clearly defined the career pathways through our colleges into middle and high-skill careers and increased the number of students traversing our pathways. This pilots that concept.

"The project is designed to help faculty and students align with advanced autonomous and electrical systems. We will conduct an Automotive Marketplace to expose auto faculty to evolving autonomous and advanced electrical systems. Employers and faculty will identify needed skills, followed by faculty trainings, and the development of curriculum to upskill auto students. We will also hire a college recruiter for high schools, develop marketing materials, hire faculty.","The automotive industry is rapidly changing and those changes are impacting our Automotive Technology programs statewide.  Automotive manufacturers are developing more advanced autonomous and electrical systems, and in order for our students to be prepared for those new technologies, our auto programs need to align with those advancements.  

For years, auto employers have been telling our instructors that community college automotive students did not need advanced ICT technical skills because these new autonomous technologies were proprietary to the auto manufacturers, and the manufacturers' engineering specialists would handle their repair and maintenance--not our students or recent graduates. However, recently, dealers and automotive manufacturers have been asking our graduates to reprogram certain systems and they reported that they are now hiring automotive technicians/students with IT skills. 

Faculty is realizing that it is time to review these new and evolving automotive technologies and identify the new skillsets that our students will need to succeed in this challenging automotive career/pathway.  Faculty also needs to be familiar with these new technologies and be trained how to maintain and repair these new technologies and systems.  Faculty will also need to develop automotive curriculum that addresses and incorporates these new autonomous and electrical systems and the identified ICT skillsets. 

Marketing materials and outreach activities need to expand to include the computer and programming skills that are now part of the auto technicians' skillsets. Participating colleges also believe that a college recruiter should be hired to effectively change the perception of guidance counselors regarding the more technical nature of automotive careers and to drive student participation in an Automotive/Aviation Tech Summer Camp.  Recruitment for college auto faculty also needs to be re-examined and supported as current faculty retires.

Recognizing that both marketing of CTE programs and the recruitment of CTE faculty are major issues of concern across the entire Bay Area Region, the BACCC will develop solutions for these two challenges.  In the meantime, the automotive RJV will review automotive marketing programs and auto faculty recruiting strategies in the region and initiate preliminary activities in these areas.",\n,\n,\n
"This project will capacity among the LA Region colleges’ noncredit Short-term Vocational programs. This will significantly contribute to the Strong Workforce Program’s purpose of producing a middle-skilled workforce. Community college noncredit programs are presently building operational infrastructure and/or programs within basic skills. Some colleges have very developed noncredit vocational programs, yet others are in need of support from colleagues with expertise in developing CTE programs. ","One of the aims of SWP is to train individuals for middle-skilled employment in high demand fields. However, many students seeking training have basic skills deficiencies and other significant barriers. Census data indicates that 23% of adults in LA County lack a high school diploma, which demonstrates a potential for low levels of literacy and numeracy skills. In Los Angeles County, 57% of the population speaks a language other than English at home and 18% of the population’s income is below a living wage (the poverty line), so the flexible and open access nature of noncredit make it possible to serve students from different socioeconomic, language, and educational backgrounds. In some cities within the Los Angeles Region, unemployment rates are as high as 7-9%, which is about 2% higher than the County average. Moreover, individuals with some college or less earn lower annual wages than those with degrees or certifications. As a result, students are not prepared for college CTE coursework. Based on the above data, it is evident that a high need population exists outside of the traditional student who enrolls in CTE programs. Recruiting these particular individuals into CTE pathways via noncredit will lead to more significant improvements in the regional economy. Noncredit is a viable option, and more importantly, courses are free to students and thus, provide access to individuals who may not otherwise have had the opportunity for free vocational training.   This project can help students be ready for CTE credit coursework by first taking noncredit contextualized and pre-CTE courses and decreasing the skills gap. Examples of contextualized courses are Math for Health Careers, Reading and Writing for Business Careers, Vocational ESL for Welding, and Pre-CTE coursework tailored to a specific CTE discipline. 

Round 1 focused on developing these noncredit contextualized courses, but through the engagement with participating colleges, it brought to light that this project should not end with curriculum development. There was a need expressed by all participating colleges to continue this project in order to support and develop noncredit CTE at all colleges in the LA Region. In addition, this project also addresses the need for a noncredit resources within the LA Region. 

Round 2 project will expand pathways to credit and work with pre-CTE and pre-apprenticeship courses and programs. The following describes the activities of the plan for Round 2, Years 1 and 2.  

1) In order for colleges to develop noncredit vocational programs and CTE pathways, funds to hire noncredit adjunct faculty will be provided to each college. The project faculty will identify CTE pathways to employment and credit CTE programs that are specific to each campus and also meet regional labor demand. These faculty will write curriculum and certificates for their colleges. All participating faculty will be provided professional development to serve in this role by the faculty lead, who will originate from Mt. San Antonio College. There are also experienced noncredit faculty at other regional colleges such as West Los Angeles, Los Angeles Trade Tech, Glendale, Cerritos, Los Angeles City, Los Angeles Mission, and Citrus, who are excellent project resources.  

2) This project will create noncredit pre-CTE coursework and certificates, and they will be mapped to credit pathways and work. Faculty from the 19 colleges will also include credit faculty, some of whom are already connected to the noncredit Round 1 curriculum project. For example, noncredit courses and certificates are already being created in graphic design at Rio Hondo College even though this was not part of the Round 1 Workplan. These courses will focus on career exploration in the field and provide students with an introductory overview of the history, academic pathways, professional practices, and career paths of a specific industry. Long Beach City College is using a similar structure in their automotive technology department. Upon completion of the courses, students will earn noncredit certificates and will be able to enter into employment or a credit CTE program. Noncredit vocational faculty will be able to outreach to their credit colleagues to develop pathways. And at Mt. SAC, based on the North America’s Building Trades Union (NABTU), in Round 1, the faculty lead wrote pre-apprenticeship curriculum and program for the Construction Trades. 

3)  An important activity is to identify discipline experts within each college to provide context for the noncredit coursework. This project seeks to build upon the pathway to priority occupations identified by the Center for Competitive workforce sectors. Based on extensive research conducted by the Round 1 faculty lead, it is evident that colleges are generally focused on developing programs that align with the sectors. These areas include health occupations, transportation, construction trades, and others. As previously mentioned, some of these experts, some being credit faculty, have emerged in Round 1 and are eager to support the development of the pathways for priority sectors.  

4)  One of the major activities in Round 2 will be to ensure that noncredit CTE readiness coursework and pre-CTE coursework developed in Round 1 can be implemented effectively. Therefore, coursework, teaching modules, and materials will be created and shared with LA/OC colleges. Participating colleges expressed that it was a major accomplishment to create the noncredit vocational coursework and programs. Preparing materials that meet the needs of noncredit students and adequately prepare them for college and work is beyond the capacity of developing colleges due to the availability of noncredit faculty and in some cases existing expertise. Experienced noncredit faculty from participating colleges and the project lead will be the important resources for this part of the project. This activity will span both years of Round 2 and will require adequate faculty time. 

5)  A project activity is to develop webinars by noncredit faculty providing teaching strategies and use of materials for courses developed in this project. It is expected that within Year 2 of Round 2, all colleges will have offered noncredit CTE courses. Teaching demonstrations will help provide faculty with additional tools to offer these courses. They will support both credit and noncredit in offering effective and relevant instruction. Delivering noncredit instruction can be very different than credit instruction, even in the CTE disciplines. Noncredit students have endured tremendous barriers and are often lacking in both the academic and soft skills needed for college or work. These barriers include limited English and basic skills, no high school diploma, and numerous situational factors. This activity will occur Round 2, Year 2.   

6)  Professional development is a major activity taking place in both years of Round 2. It is planned for larger scale training such as IBEST, which is Washington’s Integrated Basic Education and Skills Training Program (I-BEST). The program is faculty designed and is intended to train faculty in contextualizing literacy, work, and college-readiness skills so students can transition into college or into living wage jobs faster. There is also a plan in Year 1 to request faculty from the State Academic Senate to conduct a training for regional faculty on developing curriculum and certificates, particularly in CTE. Other professional development will evolve as faculty needs emerge. 

7) Ultimately, CTE courses developed within Round 1 and 2 will be taught at participating colleges. It is a goal of this project that every college will offer new CTE noncredit contextualized courses in English, math, and VESL.   8) Staffing for the project will include a Project Manager and Faculty Lead. The faculty lead will provide assistance to faculty colleagues, learn from existing faculty experts, and act as the liaison between the program manager and the faculty. The faculty lead will also facilitate training on curriculum and instruction. The Project Manager is of vital importance due to the scope of the project and the number of participating colleges. The Mt. SAC Continuing Education Dean and the current faculty lead have coordinated the Round 1 project. However, a dedicated manager to coordinate, organize, and create, in Year 1, a more structured and comprehensive timeline, is critically needed for the success of the program and to ensure the overall goal of building capacity for noncredit CTE in the LA/OC region. 

8)  Establishing, clarifying, and solidifying CTE pathways with our K-12 partners as part of this project must occur and is an important activity of this plan. There are various regional plans, including our local Workforce Development Boards and Adult Education Regional Plans that stipulate we are to engage our partners and create pathways. With the onset of Guided Pathways, this Workplan activity is timely and will be addressed in both years. It is expected that in collaboration with K-12 adult school partners, this project will develop a strategic plan to identify effective braiding of resources and to clarify and create more effective pathways to include our K-12 adult education partners, noncredit vocational programs, and credit CTE programs. Some activities of the strategic plan will be implemented in Year 2 of this Round. Existing best practices for collaboration with K-12 adult education partners will be noted and strongly considered.

"The Transportation Workforce Institute (TWI) at LATTC aims to ensure a well-trained and diverse transportation workforce. TWI’s reach is national – constructing and disseminating model, sharable curriculum and workforce development resources based on national industry standards and certifications. TWI’s impact is also regional – leading industry,education, and workforce development partners in creating programs and services that meet immediate and long-term employer needs. ","There are several, significant needs that provide this provides the motivation and rationale for this project.

First, the region has an extensive, complex, and one of the largest transportation networks in the country and is a significant contributor to a robust economy and quality of life. The partnering colleges in this project are committed to ensuring the sector remains regionally competitive with the requisite, trained workforce. The industry (and it’s 10 subsectors) currently employs 194,387 individuals and is projected to employ an additional 8,825 individuals (for a total of 203,211) by 2020. There were 6,844 transportation establishments in the region in 2016 with occupations that pay, on average, family- sustaining wages (e.g. average earnings per job is $71,414). Furthermore, nearly 1/3rd of the workforce is eligible to retire within the next 5-10 years and significant job growth from replacement positions will transpire. In addition to transportation’s size and scope as an industry in-and-of itself, it intersects and supports other, significant industries that support the economic vitality of the region such as international trade. In summary, the industry has been and will continue to be a significant source of middle-skill occupations with economic-mobility potential.

Second, Measure M is projected to infuse an estimated $120 billion into the region’s economy over four decades as the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) and other transportation agencies in the region build new highway projects, expand bus and rail lines, and expand operations. The projected employment figures provided above, do not include estimated employment growth due to Measure M. However, this project specifically seeks to supply the requisite middle-skill workforce to support the implementation of the measure which will be substantial. For example, a recent report by The Institute for Applied Economics of the Los Angeles Economic Development Corporation estimates that an additional 465,690 jobs (and specifically within the transportation and warehousing sector an additional 12,630 jobs) will be generated by the construction projects alone. Given the size and scope of the measure, and the fact that there hasn’t been another project of its size in our regions history, it requires a coordinated approach by multiple colleges across the region which is the intent of this project.

And finally, this project seeks to address gaps in workforce development practices and infrastructure that is applicable beyond just the transportation industry/sector and community college programs of study. These gaps addressed by this project are: (a) the lack of integrated, coordinated, regional certificate and degree pathways where students can attend one or more colleges seamlessly and without incurring excess credits or time; (b) business and operational models that support the implementation and sustainability of regional pathways, and (c) establishing the infrastructure to support agile and interlinked responses to regional employer demands.

"DevOps, the use of software DEVelopment tools to automate Information Systems OPerations, requires Knowledge Skills and Abilities (KSA) that are too broad for a single college or district to teach. DevOpsNation is a collaborative program which allows regional adaptation to this rapidly-changing technology via multi-college shared ownership and guided pathways, increasing completion rates. The DevOps curriculum stacks atop the ITMC. Colleges share outlines, coordinated schedules, and completion.","DevOps is a software engineering culture and practice that aims at unifying software development (DEV) and software operations (OPS). The main characteristic of the DevOps movement is to strongly advocate automation and monitoring at all steps of software construction, from integration, testing, and releasing, to deployment and infrastructure management. DevOps aims at shorter development cycles, increased deployment frequency and more dependable releases in close alignment with business objectives.

Many of the components of Information Systems (IS) infrastructure that is used to enable business operations are now available through a subscription model. Companies such as Microsoft, Google, and IBM provide hosted solutions in the form of: 

Infrastructure as a service (IAAS): a form of Cloud computing that provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. It provides high level Application Programming Interfaces (API) to control components such as Virtual Local Area Networks (VLAN) and Virtual Machines (VM) individually or as members of a pool. This permits creation of infrastructure that scales in response to usage.
 
Software as a Service (SAAS): A licensing and delivery model in which software is centrally hosted. It si sometimes referred to as ""on-demand"" for many business applications including office software, messaging software, payroll processing software, CAD software etc.

Platform as a Service (PAAS): A category of cloud computing that delivers pre-configured servers or resources permitting users to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building, installing, configuring, and maintaining suites of information technology components.

Each of these categories of Information Systems (IS) resources represents an aggregation of underlying Information Technology components: servers, software, configuration files, data files, VLANs, etc. In order to manage these new categories of IS resources, a student needs to have mastered the underlying technologies as well as the APIs that permit these services to be orchestrated. This is the task of the DevOps curriculum: Instructing students in the underlying IT components, Instructing them in the assembly of IT components into business ready Information Systems, and Instructing them in creation and control of these components using the APIs provided by many candidate service providers.

DevOps is at the center of rapid transformation in software development and IT operations. An increasingly complex software development cycle, explosive growth in data, and distribution of services means that students must acquire Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities (KSA) that are too broad for any one college to teach and consistently update. This proposal combines DevOps applicable courses from participating colleges into a certificate and degree program. These courses stack onto the IT Model Curriculum in a guided pathway which has been shown to increase completion rates among African American and Hispanic/Latino students. Program will leverage shared BACCC Netlabs infrastructure to supplement existing pods and scenarios with new DevOps specific scenarios. Shared MOUs drive and secure enrollment at each college balancing supply and demand and leveraging other RJV investments.  Fundamental to the success of our student-centered design is expanding the geography and breadth of curriculum through Bay Area regional community college collaboration. 

The shared DevOps curriculum follows the IT Curriculum model where program applicable courses can be implemented at participating college using the same outline. Colleges are encouraged to develop a specialty and implement courses beyond those that are part of the guided pathway. If a college has already implemented the ITMC, students who complete these courses have already earned program applicable credits towards a DevOps degree or certificate. The proposal aligns with several ""Projects in Common"" as identified by the state chancellor's office and provides opportunities to leverage other RJVs for direct student benefit.

This proposal provides for more efficient employer engagement by coordinating input on program applicable curriculum through regional working groups. Participating employers then commit to providing Subject Matter Experts (SME) with the Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities (KSA) they want students enrolled in a course to gain. These SME are part of a regional pool available to participating colleges to co-teach as guest speakers with existing college faculty. This provides professional development opportunities for the faculty as they will likely be ready to teach the course alone after a few semesters of co-teaching with various SMEs. This provides the opportunity for each college to ""grow-their-own"" DevOps faculty and enables the relatively small pool of highly-skilled SME to have regional impact.

The program also partners with regional organizations that have a mission-task focus on candidate interview readiness and placement. It leverages the work of <Tech/Hire>: Oakland, part of a national placement organization with regional branches that maintain a hyper-local focus on broadening access and placement of candidates from underrepresented demographics. They help employers align entry level positions with the program's KSA and provide material to counselors at participating colleges so they can properly advise students about career pathways. They also interface with the DevOps RJV interview readiness partner OutCo.io who prepare program candidates for technical interviews and provide support through the offer & salary negotiation phases of placement. The DevOps RJV avoids creation of prep and placement centers within each college or district instead relying on regional efforts that already exist. The work done for students by <Tech/Hire>: Oakland can be replicated to <Tech/Hire>: San Francisco or any of the 72 other regional <Tech/Hire> placement centers.

The instruction will utilize shared infrastructure such as the Bay Area Community College Consortium (BACCC) Netlab. Some of the initial DevOps pathways consists of existing courses that are currently taught using Netlab. Other DevOps pathways that require VMs and VLANs that exceed the capacity of such a widely shared platform (28 Colleges simultaneously) will run on a separate shared network; a pilot with the intention of discovering the resource requirements that would enable DevOps VMs to be deployed on the next generation of BACCC Netlab infrastructure. The outcomes of this pilot will be shared with another RJV ""BACCC NETLAB+ Shared ICT Data Center""

The chosen partners for this RJV also share a mission for improving Diversity in Tech. <Tech/Hire> Oakland receives support from Opportunity@Work which has the mission of expand access. Opportunity@work is a national program that engages with regional <Tech/Hire> communities to transform hiring practices & uncover talent from nontraditional talent pools. Outco.io provides a software engineering technical interview and skill validation platform that includes options for a multi-week Tech+non-Tech curriculum. Once students are ready for placement the program provides for the acquisition of inter-personal skills necessary to land an offer.

The guided pathway design for degree and certificate programs has been shown to increase completion and retention rates among African-American students by 33% and Hispanic/Latino students by 35%. The Collaborative DevOps Guided Pathway Regional Joint Venture puts all of the components in place to increase diversity in program participation and employment outcomes for this fast growing occupation.

"The Energy Efficiency / Sustainability project is a response to the Energy Efficiency industry facing serious shortfalls in developing a skilled, trained, and available labor pool.  The project strives to develop solutions, such as outreach campaigns and integrating industry and academia in a campaign to address the shortfall.   The EC&U sector Sustainability pathways project continues an initiative that responds to sector employer’s needs for a trained and employment ready workforce. ","The September 2016 LAEDC report on the Energy/Construction sector noted “In order to meet the building needs of a growing region, the construction industry requires a continuous supply of workers... The educational and training programs that exist in Southern California are extremely valuable because they provide paths to careers in construction for all skill levels. Universities and community colleges, as well as trade and technical schools, have developed targeted programs aimed at reducing the time spent by new entrants in on-the-job training to create an occupation-ready workforce.”  Los Angeles region colleges have a significant portfolio of programs related to the energy market transformation, and a number of mechanical and electrical career pathways, many of which need to be upgraded to address emerging competencies in energy efficiency. This region offers an ideal platform to develop strategies, best practices, and evidence that can be replicated and scaled.

The Sustainability Pathways project is informed by and has evolved through inputs from industry, policy makers, economic development agencies, faculty and Deans across the region. Colleges that are participating in this initiative offer programs in Process Control, HVACR, Environmental Technologies, Water/Wastewater, Building Automation, Architecture Engineering and Technical drafting technologies, Electronics and Systems Automation, Construction Crafts, Inspection, Welding Technologies, Construction Management and Data Analytics.  Economic, public policy and labor market research are the primary drivers for this project:
a) Annual demand for the target occupations in Los Angeles County is 5000+ versus~2,000 completers
b) New competencies are needed in all target occupations to accommodate industry trends in Energy Efficiency statutory goals and new/retrofitted building code compliance
c) Technology is changing the way projects are managed, how materials are produced and the building process itself. The introduction of new technologies has helped to streamline, automate and speed up building design and construction
d) Policies and incentives arising from California’s clean energy and pollution reduction mandates continue to accelerate industry’s evolution to automated solutions
e)  Clean Energy and Pollution Reduction Act of 2015. the Governor has called for a new set of objectives in clean energy, clean air, and pollution reduction for 2030 and beyond. 1) To increase from 33 percent to 50 percent, the procurement of our electricity from renewable sources. (2) To double the energy efficiency savings in electricity and natural gas of retail customers through energy efficiency and conservation.
f)  Existing Buildings Energy Efficiency Action Plan (EBEE Action Plan) in September 2015. The plan provides a 10-year roadmap to activate market forces and transform California’s existing residential, commercial, and public building stock into high-performing and energy- efficient buildings. 
g) Policies and incentives for adoption of energy efficient systems are at the core of California’s strategy for economic growth and competitiveness in the global market

Legislation such as Proposition 39 and Title 24 (CA Building Code) continues to create new jobs by infusing hundreds of millions of dollars annually in energy efficient buildings and by incentivizing new private investments. New technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Direct Digital Control, Smart Sensors, Analytics, evolving HVACR and environment and control systems, Automated Building Controls, and Artificial Intelligence dominate the way buildings and processes must respond to these drivers. In addition to the supply/demand and new worker competency gaps, multiple studies show a massive need to upskill the incumbent workforce.

The foundation of the EC&U sustainability project is the “Expert Network” of willing and engaged cross-sector Faculty Champions that fosters a channel for industry driven competencies, common outcomes, stackable credentials and credit transportability across regional colleges. The expert network develops as a learning community which thru collaboration and innovation transform the regional programs. Advancing student success by aligning content and outcomes with third party evidence based benchmarks and assessments leading to industry valued credentials. Exploring and implementing work experience and internship programs. Recognizing existing demands on faculty, this project assists in curriculum alignment and development by funding consultants to work at the direction of faculty. It also provides funding for adjunct instructors and guest lecturers to deliver specialized content modules that are infused into existing courses and programs. Professional development opportunities and access to available online and virtual training and assessment program augmentation tools.

The Sustainability Pathways has a primary focus of engaging and expanding an existing Industry Advisory comprised of the Association Energy Engineers, Siemens, Johnson Controls, Honeywell, ABM, Association of Air Conditioning Contractors (ACCA) ASHRAE, International Facilities Management Association, So California Edison, UA250, Operating Engineers local 501, and others with a strong presence in the county. Significant contributions to this advisory are being made by UC Davis, the Southern California HVACR Collaborative, and the National Science Foundation BEST Center.
This initiative includes:
1. Alignment of student learning outcomes across the region’s programs
2. Transfer of certificate or degree-level credits across participating colleges
3. Convening and sustaining an Expert Network that engages industry in faculty planning
4. Professional development for faculty, aligned with industry priorities

Laptops will be incorporated in the instruction of troubleshooting newer diesel engines and equipment systems,such as hydraulics.  New courses will be developed that provide students with the knowledge and skills that will make them prepared for WSL opportunities as well as entry-level employment.

The addition of an additional faculty member to assist with creating and teaching new advanced diesel electronics, advanced electronic fuel systems and hybrid automotive courses will 1) create additional enrollment, 2) better prepare graduates to work in repair facilities and dealerships, and 3) explore scheduling courses in a manner that reduces time to degree.  The additional faculty member will also work with the existing faculty members and other to increase the number of employers who participate on advisory councils, sponsor work-site learning experiences, and are interested in employing graduates.

The Launchboard Snapshot Data for 2014-15 indicated that Butte College offered 37 sections (237 students) in Automotive Technology compared to Shasta's 24 sections (134 students).  Since Butte is just a little larger than Shasta, they are doing a better job of attracting and retaining students in their automotive programs.

1) Three new courses will be developed; 2) existing courses and certificates will be improved; 3) scheduling of courses will enable to enroll in a greater number of courses at one time and reduce the time to completion; 4) increased employer interest in courses will motivate students to complete; 5) increased WSL experiences will provide students with appropriate skills and help them gain entry-level experiences; and 6) a greater number of students will complete and apply for degrees and certificates.",\n,\n,\n

"To expand CTE faculty in Heavy Equipment Operations to meet current student demand and market needs. With expanded faculty, update curriculum and technology infrastructure for the program to improve workplace readiness of students.","The completion of this program positions individuals to go to work immediately.  Having the skills to operate heavy equipment and/or have an A or B commercial truck driving license opens doors in many business sectors across the country.  Employers want to hire individual with experience and are cautious about the liability of hiring inexperienced drivers and operators.  Shasta Colleges Equipment Operations program strengths are that it is a two semester program and the amount and quality of seat time student gain during their time in the program.  This past year the program had 50 new students with even more students projected for next year.  The need for more equipment to allow the additional students to have valuable seat time is needed.  This proposal would fund the accusation of some equipment and the lease of other construction equipment.

At the end of the three year’s programs numbers should double.  This program generates high FTES as students have a lot of time in class, so extra funding generated by the program could go towards increased equipment budgets and another full time instructor.  Some equipment could also be shared on a regional biases with other colleges.  As more students are placed with area companies more potential employers will be willing to loan or donate equipment for training purposes.

Expand the offerings of Heavy Equipment Operation in the Far North by offering more sections of traditional construction operations and by expanding the offerings to include crane and forestry operations.  Improve the Class A & B Commercial License training by providing trainees more opportunity to gain experience by providing them time on heavy equipment and track driving simulators.",\n,\n,\n

"To provide a Paraprofessional in Welding who can support teaching and learning outcomes by freeing faculty to spend more time with students and on program priorities by ordering supplies, receiving shipments, setting up classroom labs, handling and disposing of materials, making repairs or work orders for repairs and surplus items, researching for purchase of materials and equipment, and other non-instructional activities that are nonetheless required for a successful industrial program.","Since 2011/12 the enrollment has increased from 680 to 814 in 2015/16.  Currently, if a class of 20 (utilizing all 20 welders in the 2500 lab) experiences a machine malfunction, 1 student has to stop welding and the instructor must fix the welder for the student to return to his assignments, this chain reacts into all the other students losing contact time with the instructor while they fix the problem (5 to sometimes 45 minutes).  A paraprofessional would work off a maintenance schedule not only reducing this from occurring, but also be able to take over the malfunction repair and allow the instructor to continue teaching.  We currently have within our facility 48 booths, and over 100 welding machines of which due to basic use do malfunction periodically and require troubleshooting.

Currently the Welding Department processes, welds, and recycles approximately 40 tons of steel per year.  We are able to use student labor to help process the material when their skill level is commensurate with the task, but often it falls to the instructor to ready materials.  Due to our schedule of classes there is little to no time to complete these tasks.  We have seen an increase in purchasing new material due to the lack of time available in processing the donated material.  Also, the donated material must be sought and collected from our regional partners.  This important task keeps the operating costs reduced.

A paraprofessional would allow the welding instructors to increase contact time with the students by at least 5 hours per week, per full-time equivalent instructor.  This contact time will show an increase in retention, and most notably, completions.",\n,\n,\n

"This project will enhance regional alignment and collaboration to broadly scale up career pathways and provide dual enrollment and early college credit opportunities through technical assistance, resource development, and enhanced data use. The alignment and standardization of these processes will significantly improve CTE student enrollments, completion, transfer rates, employment and earnings that align with the Strong Workforce Program metrics.","Career pathways provide a seamless sequence of academic and CTE coursework across K-12 and post-secondary education.  As the California Community Colleges Chancellor, Eloy Ortiz Oakley has described: Pathways are a road map to get students from point A to the workforce. They serve as accelerators for students to easily transition from educational programs to meet the growing need for a skilled workforce.  However, implementing career pathways across the K-12 and higher education systems is challenging and complex. Pathways are multifaceted and require alignment and collaboration across systems and new roles and organizational structures to ensure success.

Across the country, states and districts are developing career pathways using dual enrollment and early college credit that encourage students interested in career-focused programming to make progress toward an industry-recognized credential or degree while still in high school. According to a recent report, How to Scale College in High School , nationally, more than 30% of enrollment by high school students in dual and concurrent enrollment courses is in career education.  In California, the Board of Governors Task Force on Workforce, Job Creation and a Strong Economy presented findings describing the implementation of career pathways as a compelling framework for systemic change to drive student success in reaching educational goals.  Among the recommendations adopted were: supporting faculty and colleges to design pathways with multiple entry and exit points that correspond to industry-recognized credentials; development of state-aligned or regionally-aligned strategies and structured industry-informed pathways that seamlessly transition high school and adult students to community college programs of study; and alignment of CTE curricula that facilitate articulation, dual enrollment and CTE pathways. 

At the K-12 level, as of the 2017-2018 school year California now includes dual enrollment courses and pathway completion as an indicator of college and career readiness to be reported in the state accountability systems. This redesign of the state’s school accountability system is replacing the Academic Performance Index, which was primarily an aggregate of test scores. The indicators contain college measures that recognize options for students to prepare for post-secondary education and entry to the workforce.  Career Technical Education (CTE) pathway completion, plus completion of one semester of dual enrollment with a passing grade in academic and/or CTE subjects provide evidence that students have achieved a “Prepared” level according to the College and Career Readiness Indicators (CCRI).  Implementation of the college and career readiness indicators are expected to drive K-12 interest in expanding dual enrollment with college partners.

Data from Orange County CTE course and pathway enrollments present evidence of a growing pipeline of students.  Data reported by the K-12 OC Pathways program shows that in the 2016-2017 school year, the top five pathways by enrollment were: Design, Visual, and Media Arts, Patient Care, Engineering Design, Biotech, and Software and Systems Development.   The college and career readiness indicators are increasing K-12 interest in expanding dual enrollment opportunities for students, and underscore the need for a systematic process to institutionalized pathways.  The proposal development team gathered data from key stakeholders to assess regional needs for expanding career pathways and early college credit. 

Addressing regional needs - Interviews with college vice-presidents, deans, and assistant superintendents from high school districts implementing dual enrollment agreements provided firsthand information on the process.  The project team also sought recommendations from SB 1070 Work Group and from high school and college counselors.   The project team summarized the findings from across these groups into three focus areas for program development: 1) Program design and planning; 2) Program implementation; and 3) Program analysis and data use.

Program design and planning - Administrators noted that the identification of pathways and early college credit programs are capitalizing on existing offerings at the community college.   However, the process of course identification is intuitive rather than systematic and not yet linked to strategic planning.  The cost of textbooks was cited as an example of decision making criteria for identifying dual enrollment courses.  Administrators mentioned that they would like to see more strategic approaches to assess high potential pathways for expanding dual enrollment, and a more data driven approach to course selection. 

Program implementation - It was common for administrators and program coordinators to describe dual enrollment, particularly the College and Career Access Pathway agreements as enhancing opportunities to promote and develop pathway partnerships. However, they also mentioned struggling to negotiate contractual, academic, and student support requirements while building relationships with partners that are critical to long-term success.  
- There was interest expressed in developing shared resources and documents including memoranda of understanding, College and Career Access Pathway partnership agreements, and resources for building awareness of programs. 
- Administrators mentioned that assistance is needed to specify key roles and commit human and financial resources to coordinating and monitoring dual enrollment programs.  They cited a need for more coordinated staffing plans, and ongoing funding to assure success.
- Counselors play a central role in helping students navigate their academic and career pathways.  Research conducted by over fifty K-12 and college counselors as part of an SB 1070 initiative, show that early college credit practices relevant to CTE and career pathways are still in a preliminary stage of development. Although strong single site examples exist, continued work is needed to develop early college credit practices that effectively integrate career pathways across Orange County and promote long term sustainability. 
- A critical issue in increasing awareness and understanding of career pathways is the need for counselor professional development, so that counselors can acquire knowledge of policies, key terminology, and procedures to guide students in accelerating their course-taking and program completion. Counselors noted that professional development certifications on career pathway support should be explored as model programs for counselors.

Program analysis and data use - Administrators and program coordinators are keenly aware of the need to validate program impact to strengthen and improve dual credit that address the metrics for the Strong Workforce Program.  Stakeholders said that they need information on pathways and dual enrollment reported on a timely basis for decision making.  One area of interest is an analysis of programs and students in the pipeline to determine the greatest potential for growth of the dual enrollment courses. For example, how many students in dual enrollment courses go to a CSU or UC versus coming to a community college.  Both administrators and staff coordinators also noted several other areas for technical assistance, resource development, and data use.
- Early engagement and buy-in by college faculty and high school teachers, and time for high school and college faculty to work together.
- Understanding K-12 instructional time requirements, apportionment, and program funding.
- Developing a standard handbook and orientation practices to ensure understanding of program purpose, policies and procedures.
- Professional development to support teachers in obtaining skills and credentials in order to teach as part of a dual enrollment.
- Creating resources for parents to create awareness of programs and address access to students’ data.

Coast District will work with districts and colleges and K-12 partners to develop the Pathways and Early College Credit Regional Scale Up project with all of the regional community colleges and North Orange Continuing Education, along with partners such as the Career Ladders Project, Hanover Research, the Education Development Center.
Currently, Coast District leads the SB 1070 Strong Workforce Career Pathways Program grant for Orange County, providing leadership and technical assistance to regional community colleges and K-12 school districts to develop policy and procedural changes that support high school articulation and dual enrollment, expand industry-relevant credentials, promote regional pathways. Coast District has the resources, leadership and experience to scale up this project across Orange County. Coast District also recognizes the broader initiative of guided pathways emerging as the driving vision for implementing an integrated approach to student success, and will work closely with the California Community Colleges Chancellor’s Office and key stakeholders on these initiatives.

West Hills & Delta College received an Award for Innovation to lead devt. of the Program in the CRC Region, this SWP will leverage that & allow for 100% reg. participation","Data shows that the use of Prior Learning Assessment can help increase demand and completions and decrease the cost and time to degree.With a focus on CTE, the end goal of the project is to scale the PLA Program out to the other colleges in the region and ultimately to the rest of the colleges in the State.   -    With birth rates and high school rates flattening, growing demand has become a priority and a challenge for colleges.  In response, postsecondary institutions are beginning to take an expanded view of degree-seekers, focusing on attracting post-traditional students (25 and over).  Serving post-traditional adult learners, however, presents the challenge of modifying existing institutional processes designed for traditional students.   The QuickPath PLA Program (PLA) provides a solution by leveraging one of the best kept secrets in postsecondary education, prior learning assessment.  With program partners AcademyOne and the Council for Adult and Experiential Learning (CAEL), and faculty at the pilot colleges West Hills Community College Coalinga and Lemoore, and San Joaquin Delta College leading the initiative, the QuickPath Program is designed to simplify the navigation of prior learning assessment options and expand the offerings to include credit by portfolio assessment. In revealing all the ways students are able to earn credit for their prior learning in an easy-to-navigate platform, colleges will be able to highlight the systems which help students decrease the cost of attendance and time to degree.  With faculty driving the development of portfolio assessment at the pilot colleges, institutions will be able to grow enrollment of post-traditional students who have industry skills and competencies that align with certificate and degree programs, but who do not possess formal credentials or degrees.  Portfolio assessment offers adult learners a way to demonstrate the prior learning they gained from years of industry experience and earn credit for what they already know.  

The QuickPath PLA Program is a faculty led and designed program that allows colleges to offer course credit to students who can demonstrate prior learning. PLA expands the traditional offerings beyond Challenge Exams and CLEP tests to include credit by portfolio assessment. Data shows that the use of Prior Learning Assessment can help increase demand and completions and decrease the cost and time to degree.  West Hills and San Joaquin Delta College received a $2 million Award for Innovation to spearhead the development of the QuickPath Program in the Central Region. The money is being used to pay for a full time coordinator for the program (Dr. Justin Garcia),  AcademyOne’s work to design a multi-institutional regional web platform to facilitate and simplify the navigation of prior learning assessment options for students, the fee for hosting each of the region’s colleges on the QuickPath online platform during Year 1 (ends April 2018), stipends for faculty to develop the policies, procedures, guidelines, regional marketing for all of the colleges, and assessments for the web platform, and consulting fees for The Council for Adult and Experiential Learning (CAEL) who is providing consulting services to faculty as they develop the Portfolio Assessment processes and practices .   As supported by the CCCCO, West Hills and Delta need full regional college input in regards to CAEL and AcademyOne to develop the pilot program. The end goal of the pilot is to scale the PLA Program out to the other colleges in the region and ultimately to the rest of the colleges in the State. College faculty and Admin champions need to be identified to serve as the contact points for the initiative and to work with CAEL and AcademyOne to ensure the success and scalability of the pilot project. 

This SWP involves all 14 CRC colleges and includes collaboration with the South Coast Central Region to assist them with their PLA efforts.  As part of the program: o	AcademyOne to train administrators, faculty, and staff to use the platform to serve the students at their respective institution; o	CAEL led PLA-training for administrators, faculty, and staff; o	Professional development for faculty to serve as portfolio assessors and evaluate portfolios for credit; and o	Develop Prior Learning Assessment marketing materials to drive interest to the regional web-enabled portal.",\n,\n,\n

"The OC Work-Based Learning and Job Placement project is designed to research, develop, and implement a sustainable, regional approach to career services, work-based learning, internship, job placement, and employment engagement for students, employers, colleges/schools, and community partners. This network will be designed to promote: career exploration, employability skills attainment, employer engagement, work-based learning, and job placement opportunities to address Strong Workforce metrics.","What Needs Motivate the Project:

The needs that motivate this project are not unique to the nine (9) Orange County colleges and the North Orange Continuing Education (NOCE) center (referred to subsequently as the 10 Orange County institutions). Due to past funding methods and accountability measures, most institutions have focused on student retention and completion of certificates while dedicating limited resources to provide students with the full pathway from education to the workforce.

For example, all 10 Orange County institutions provide some level of career services to students, traditionally focused on providing career exploration and academic program information. An area that requires greater focus is in providing experiential learning tied directly to career pathways, development of employability skills, and job placement. 

In addition to the limited focus on the later stages of career pathways continua, artificial boundaries and silos based on each institutions’ service area, hinders greater access for students to employment opportunities throughout the county and employers’ access to a broader base of potential employees. This lack of regional coordination frustrates employers and ultimately causes them to disengage from partnering with community colleges. Due to the fact, each institution uses a different system and process for managing internship and job placements, employers have a difficult time finding and navigating multiple systems and are discouraged from listing their opportunities with colleges.

Included below are the regional needs as identified by a workgroup that included colleges, adult education providers, employer representative groups and community partner agencies:

•	Student Needs: career, industry, and college exploration; ability to engage in work-based learning opportunities; job readiness (employability) skills; electronic portfolios that allow students to collect, organize, and highlight their skills and experiences; and access to employment opportunities throughout the Orange County region and not be limited to only those employers in a single school’s service area.

•	Employer Needs: ease of access to a centralized job board, ability to create multiple levels of relationships with faculty and programs whether it be one-to-one, one-to-many, or one-to-all (employer to make the decision); opportunities to create career awareness within an industry/business; ability to identify business/industry employees who might serve as faculty; ability to connect with multiple campuses without duplication of effort, incumbent training, mechanisms to present their company information (such as their company profile, types of jobs are available, and the different skills they are seeking from qualified candidates); the ability to host field trips and/or job shadowing/mentoring opportunities; and increased knowledge of the training programs offered at each of the institutions. 

•	College Needs: student metrics and data reports; ability to identify business/industry employees who might serve as faculty; increased employer engagement; ease of access to regional opportunities and companies (platform and tool); the ability to help meet employer needs throughout the region and not be limited to only the service area when the need is greater than one school can provide; a system that honors long standing relationships if an employer decides they only want a one-to-one relationship; increased linkages and tracking capabilities to allow for tracking students from high school to college to employment; a platform that can assist with online vetting of companies to ensure that the job postings are from legitimate places of business; and professional development opportunities for integration of statewide tools, resources, and 21st century skills training/curriculum materials.

•	Regional Needs: the ability to utilize and access the strengths of all regional resources without duplicating efforts; ensure vertical alignment (Chambers, Workforce Development Boards, One-Stop Centers, Other Community Partners, K-12s, Colleges, Adult Education Centers, Adult Education Block Grant Consortia, Deputy Sector Navigators, and Universities); stronger employer engagement; student and employer-centric job placement services; the ability to provide additional resources to our students (such as childcare, tuition support, books, etc.); increased employment, internship, and work-based learning opportunities; alignment with all of the CCCCO’s supported tools and resources to ensure that regionally we are capitalizing on their benefits; identifying the gaps and assessing the needs within the region to increase the education-to-employment pathway; and identifying how we best serve all student populations (working adults, high school graduates, special populations, veterans, international students, alumni, and at-risk students).

How Project will Address These Needs:

The regional project is divided into three different sections: Foundational, Long-Term Sustainability, and Short-Term Pilot Projects. It is important that the region have a strong understanding of the current groundwork available and in use within the region. This base knowledge will allow the workgroup and partners to determine which new tools and resources would work best in creating a unified, regional platform, which will comprise the Foundational section of this project. While it is great to have the opportunity to apply for regional Strong Workforce funding to develop this regional project, the workgroup is cognizant that the development and adoption of a regional platform must be able to be maintained in the long-term and sustainable when/if Strong Workforce funding ends. With that in mind, we will be running competitive, short-term pilots of existing local partner efforts regarding employer engagement and/or job placement to test their ability to be scaled-up for used throughout the region and/or new pilots to determine how we best leverage services offered by our community partners while eliminating duplication of community college services. It is envisioned that both the long-term and short-term pilots will run in tandem with a Regional Work-Based Learning and Job Placement Steering Committee; comprised of the 10 Orange County institutions, regional community partners, K-12, and other state-wide initiative staff members; eventually deciding which pilot programs are most effective for long-term sustainability as part of the regional platform.

Vision:
All Orange County Community Colleges, students, community partners, and employers are engaged and working collaboratively on a seamless platform to meet the needs of job seekers, employers, and our region.

"Support to increase enrollment and student success through community outreach, curriculum development, and industry engagement.","Culinary faculty need support with administrative tasks in order to free up time to participate in community outreach, curriculum development, and industry engagement activities.

"This project proposes two key activities: 1) The development of a new certificate and degree in Hospitality Management which will lead to increased student enrollments, degrees and certificate completions, and a labor force that meets the growing demand for employees in the hotel and hospitality field in the region; and 2) the creation and funding of a permanent Culinary Arts Supervisor position to support the success of the Hospitality Management and Culinary Arts Department.","This project will have two distinct outcomes and outcome periods: 1) the development of a new certificate and degree in Hospitality Management, with a focus on the hotel industry. This portion of the project will increase student enrollments, degrees and certificate completions, and help meet the growing demand for employees in the hotel and hospitality field in the Sacramento region. This outcome will be made possible with the second project component; and 2) the creation and funding of a permanent Culinary Arts Supervisor position for the Hospitality Management and Culinary Arts Department.  This supervisory position is imperative to ensure increased numbers of students, persistence and ultimately certificates. Round one of Strong Workforce originally approved a faculty coordinator that would have handled many of these functions.  However, for a number of reasons, the position was ultimately not approved by the district and not filled. This modified proposal will better meet the needs of the students and the college. 

This position will be responsible for the following:
•	Supervise and coordinate existing Instructional Assistants and the on campus work experience component of the program, which includes restaurant and baking operations.
•	Supervise students in their on campus work experience requirements.
•	Purchasing for all HM labs (a function currently out of class for Instructional Aids.)
•	Build relationships with local hotels to create internship opportunities for Hospitality Management degree students.
•	Act as high school and industry liaison to coordinate high school and industry visits, and tours.

The Culinary Arts and Hospitality Management Expanded Success Program is motivated by the department’s culture of continuous improvement and growth. This culture and plan tie directly to the Strong Workforce goal of “More and Better.”  This project will result in increased student counts, increased persistence, increase in the number of degrees and certificates awarded, and most importantly will help meet the economic employment needs of the region, and result in higher wages for those who complete our programs. 

In 2017 Sacramento was listed as one of the top 10 growth regions for hotel development in the United States. The opening of the Golden One Center as well as the opening of numerous restaurants in the area (The Sacramento Bee reported over 20 planned restaurant opening in downtown Sacramento alone for 2017), equates to over 1,000 new restaurant jobs being created in the last 2 years. The California Restaurant Association states that Sacramento now has more restaurants per capita than any city in California only behind San Francisco, and qualified employees are in high demand. The opening of new hotels and the arena further support the economic foundation for restaurant employees.

The LMI data provided shows an unmet need of over 1,300 open positions, specific to foodservice and not taking into account the additional opportunities within the hotel market.

The scope of this plan not only meets each of the primary objectives for strong workforce: 
•	Increasing number of students enrolled
•	Increase programs (new certificate & degree)
•	Improve persistence and completion rates
•	Improve quality of courses
But also meets several of the Task Force Recommendations:
•	Improve CTE student progress and outcome
•	Develop industry-informed career pathways that prepare students for jobs needed within the regional labor market
•	Evaluate, strengthen, and revise curriculum 

Additionally, this plan is supported by both the departmental EMP and Program Review which was completed last year. The strong workforce support will allow this program to move forward with the investment that has prevented it from coming to fruition. 

The Supervisor position will remove responsibilities from existing instructional assistant allowing them to focus on student support as intended. Over the past 17 years the instructional assistant support has remained stagnant, although the program has grown four fold, the number of classes just in hot food has gone from 2 lab sections to 8, with the size of the student run restaurant more than doubling. Instructional assistants have always been responsible for the purchasing and set up of labs, and the running of the student run restaurant, both are technically out of class. Yet without these functions the department cannot run.  This position will add the necessary support to meet the needs of the lab classes, and allow the IA’s to redirect their attention where it belongs, on student success. 

Hotel Curriculum and Degree (New Student Market/Growth)
This program will create the only local pipeline for potential hotel employees. Hotel employees are paid at a higher wage than entry level restaurant employees, which will increase pay opportunities for students and graduates entering the workforce.   
A degree and certificate will be created by interdisciplinary faculty, combining exiting HM courses, BUS courses and possible new courses. This will be done in coordination with the Sacramento Hotel Association to meet local industry needs. The inaugural program can be offered without the need for additional FTE, although this could change in the future as demand grows. 

The new Culinary Arts Supervisor will work with industry to create internship opportunities and assist in placing students in positive off campus work environments. 

Current Student Pipeline Success, Retention, and Growth
The addition of the Culinary Arts Supervisor will improve the student in house work experience dynamic, further supporting the instruction given by the instructors and providing additional direct support to students. This position will alleviate the purchasing and supervisory duties currently held by the department’s IAs which will allow them to work within class and focus their attention on assisting and aiding students. A fundamental component of this position is keep the IAs within class and alleviate the college and district from potential employment litigation. From a student perspective, the increased availability of Instructional Assistance to support their learning process will increase both success and retention. 
 
The Culinary Arts Supervisor will also work with local feeder high schools to ensure local culinary and hospitality high school students can visit the program as they make their college choices. This position will also work with departmental faculty to help ensure articulation agreements are up to date. This higher level of coordination with feeder high schools will also serve to increase student counts.

"Paid internships will be provided for students in a variety of disciplines with salaries provided for discipline-specific faculty coordinators for regional internships at each of the three VCCCD colleges: Ventura, Oxnard, and Moorpark.  Funds will also be used for faculty coordination, office supplies, equipment and software required to create a central internship office at each college.  Ventura College will serve as the lead college for this project.","According to the California Community Colleges' Task Force on Workforce Job Creation and a Strong Economy (released on April 2015), work-based learning, such as internships and project-based learning opportunities can help students apply their knowledge, gain valuable hands-on experience, and develop the day-one readiness and fundamental skills necessary to secure and succeed in the labor market.  Paid work-based learning and apprenticeship programs allow students to develop relevant skills while earning money to cover living expenses.  Without access to these opportunities, many students will seek paid employment unrelated to their pathways and likely slow their college completion and career advancement.  Internships provide students the opportunity to apply the theories and techniques of their discipline in a professional setting under the instruction of a faculty mentor and site supervisor.  Internships introduce students to aspects of the roles and responsibilities of professional employed in their field of study.  Topics to be covered include goal setting, employment skills development, and examination of the world of work as it relates to the student's career plans.  Internships will last one semester and students may repeat the internship up to two times.  Students may not earn more than 16 units in any combination of cooperative work experience (general or occupational) and/or internship studies during their community college attendance.",\n,\n,\n

The second phase would be done in the 2018-2019 academic year.  This second phase would include adding video instruction for all components of the course.   This would include upwards of 25 videos.  In addition, discussion posts would be developed and incorporated within the Modules.  The Canvas shell (started in Phase 1) would be updated to include video instruction for all course navigation as well as for all instructional projects.  This video instruction would insure that the instructional content for the online course is at least equivalent to the instruction received in an on-ground classroom environment.  It is anticipated that the online course would draw from a greater population. We have seen a trend in our courses of more CPA candidates taking the basic Accounting with Excel course, and we believe most of them would go on to take Advanced Excel course.

","Need To Address Regional and State Teacher Shortage
There are 17,150 teacher openings due to replacements alone in Southern California (EDD), which reflects the high percentage of teachers near retirement: 40% of CA teachers are over 50 (Fong, 2015). Yet, enrollment in California teacher preparation programs has plummeted, declining by 66% over the past decade (CA Teacher Credentialing Commission).
This situation has educational leaders concerned that there will be a severe teacher shortage: ""the state could easily face `very severe shortages' of teachers...It takes a long time for the pipeline to recover...Prompt action is needed to prepare new teachers and avert a significant loss of educational quality"" (Freedberg, 2015).
The Learning Policy Institute report (2017) identifies that stagnant teacher supply is insufficient to meet growing teacher demand. In the past year, California’s teacher shortage has worsened as demand continues to grow and the supply of new teachers remains stagnant. New California credentials have remained constant at 11,500 since 2013–14, while growing projected annual new hires have grown and now exceed 20,000. ?According to a Center of Teaching and Learning report in February 2017, in the past year, overall teacher workforce trends in California have worsened, with especially severe consequences in special education, math, and science, and significant threats in bilingual education. Survey data suggest that, in addition to canceling courses and increasing class sizes, districts are responding to shortages by hiring underprepared teachers (teachers who have not yet completed the subject matter and teacher preparation requirements for a full credential); assigning some teachers out of their fields of preparation; and hiring substitutes, who need only pass a basic skills test. Relying on underprepared, out-of-field, and substitute teachers is a cause for concern. Evidence shows that these teachers typically depress student achievement and have higher attrition rates.  The high attrition rates of underprepared teachers create continuous demand for new teachers and exacerbate shortages.  Moreover, schools serving the most vulnerable students, including students in high-poverty, high-minority, and high-English Learner schools, disproportionately turn to underprepared teachers to meet their hiring needs.
Increasing enrollment in the CIE pathway not only addresses the workforce need for qualified educators, it also connects students to high-wage jobs: paraprofessionals in our region can earn up to $23/hour and the average teacher salary in our region is $80,363.
The proposed CIE pathway leads to high-skill, high-growth, high-wage paraprofessional and teaching occupations. Employment Development Department (EDD) LMI data show regional growth in paraprofessional and teacher openings at 10%-11%, with 392 paraprofessional openings, and 524 teacher openings, on average each year. 
The wage range for paraprofessionals in our area is $13-$23/hr, based on training and certification. This is a significant increase over the minimum wage that most of our students earn in retail and food service jobs, and contributes to students' persistence in the pathway as their earnings and their work experience support their goal to enter the teaching profession. 

Need for Teachers Better Prepared in STEM to Increase STEM Majors
As economic growth and social well-being have come to depend more on STEM fields, educators need to effectively prepare students to enter and lead in STEM-related industries. California students ranked next to last among all states participating in the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) science assessments (US Dept. of Education, 2009). Our students struggle in math and science, especially underrepresented students, due in part to teachers' discomfort and limited knowledge in these disciplines. 
A study funded by the National Science Foundation found that many teachers felt unprepared to teach math and science, and are not confident that they can provide effective math or science instruction to a diverse group of learners (Epstein, 2014). The Careers in Education Pathway Collaborative will provide extensive pre-professional development, work experience, and externship opportunities, emphasizing effective inquiry-based math and science instruction, as well as integrate math and science skills development into the pathway.
The Careers in Education Pathway Collaborative complements the region's goals for STEM-related CTE pathways, as improvement of K-12 math and science instruction is a necessary strategy to prepare the STEM workforce. Science and math are no longer subjects among many, but disciplines on which our future depends: ""professions in eight of the 10 industry clusters identified by the Orange County Workforce Investment Board require STEM competencies and skills,"" and ""Orange County believes that the development of a STEM competent workforce and citizenry begins with preschoolers and continues at every step of the education continuum thereafter"" (OC STEM Initiative). 
There is a critical need for professional development for future and current teachers: only 1/3 of teachers feel very prepared to teach science, and 85% of elementary teachers have not received any science-related professional development in the last three years (Center for the Future of Teaching and Learning, 2014); and ""too many elementary school teachers lack the know-how to teach math effectively...all of mathematics depends on what kids do in the elementary grades. If you don't do it right, you're doing remedial work all the way up to college"" (Gold, 2015).

Educators that Reflect the K-12 Population in CA
In addition to the high need for teachers in general, there is a persistent need for more Hispanic, bilingual, and teachers from ethnic minorities that better reflect the communities they serve. Consider the number of Hispanic students at our county LEAs compared with the number of Hispanic teachers: 66% of students are Hispanic, but only 15% of teachers are Hispanic (California Department of Education, 2016).
In order to do this, community colleges not only need to prepare students along the pathway for early employment working in educational environments, but increase the transfer rates of Hispanic students and other underrepresented minority group students. Though there has been increased full college Hispanic transfer rates from the three HSI (Hispanic Serving Institutions) campuses in the region, there is still much work to be done. While White student enrollment is approximately only a quarter of the colleges’ populations, white students transfer at much higher rates than Hispanic students which are nearly the majority population enrolled at the campuses. 

Need to Develop/Strengthen Careers In Education Pathways among the Nine Community Colleges and Local School District CIE Pathways
Careers in Education courses exist in all three of the OC ROPs (Central Orange County- CTEp/NOCROP/Coastline ROP), yet only a few community colleges have formal articulation agreements with one or more high school programs for this pathway. In order to increase streamlined Careers in Education pathways throughout Orange County, time and resources need to be dedicated to establish community college/K-12 partnerships, develop curriculum and articulation/dual enrollment agreements, and build infrastructure practices and processes that are sustainable.

Need to Strengthen Regional Communication and Coordination in the Education Sector
Currently model programs exist with articulated programs, stackable certificates, robust work based learning experiences, and employment acquisition, and however, these efforts are isolated to two campuses in the region. Therefore there is a need to develop connections between the model program campuses and the other seven community colleges, their feeder high schools, ROPs and local employers to facilitate the replication of these exemplary models therefore addressing the workforce needs in the region.

This state-of-the-art facility co-located within an industrial business park that has dozens of manufacturing tenants can create additional opportunities for growth and partnership.
Advanced Manufacturing 
•	Advanced Welding (expanded) – Non-Destructive Testing (NDT), Robotics Welding
•	Advanced Electronics Technology (expanded) – Industrial Testing Technicians
•	Advanced Design Technology (expanded) – CAD, Rapid Prototyping, Fabrication
•	Drone Technology (new multi-discipline)

Advanced Transportation (new and expanded courses)
•	Diesel Technology (expanded) – Clean Diesel & Compressed Natural Gas, Industrial & Fleet Maintenance
•	Automotive Technology (expanded) – Alternative Fuels & Electric Vehicles
•	Automotive Collision Technology (expanded) – Industrial Coating

Sacramento Transportation Regional Infrastructure Partners (STRIPE)
•	Carpentry Pre-Apprenticeship (expanded) – partner w/ Northern California Carpenters

Through Regional Share funds, ARC proposes the following:

Need #1: Increase enrollment
Through the acquisition of approximately 80,000 square feet in instructional space at McClellan Park, we will increase the college’s capacity to enroll students in the college’s Advanced Manufacturing and Advanced Transportation programs (Diesel, Auto Collision, Welding, Design Technology, and Carpentry Pre-Apprenticeship programs, and eventually Drone Technology).  Once fully operational, we expect to serve at least 500 additional students per year through the programs at the McClellan Center.  The ARC Workforce team will employ a variety of recruitment and outreach efforts to generate this enrollment, including: 1) leveraging the college’s Local Share funds and Pathways resources, and Carl D. Perkins funds; 2) coordinating efforts with the college’s Student Services programs; 3) strengthening or expanding partnerships with employers in Advanced Manufacturing/Advanced Transportation, as well as regional industry associations; and 4) expanding partnerships with local workforce agencies (e.g. Sacramento Employment and Training Agency), County offices of education, and adult education providers.

Need #2: Training for regional employer needs
The McClellan Innovation Center is currently being designed as a flexible learning space that can be customized for different training needs. Classroom and lab space will be outfitted with a diversity of technologies and tools that support learning in Advanced Manufacturing.  These features of the McClellan Innovation Center will allow us to serve employers in new ways.  For example, employers will be able to contract with the college to provide specialized instruction, rent facilities for their own purposes (e.g. R & D), and/or collaborate directly with faculty and their students on innovative projects, e.g. in the way that the college’s existing Design Hub (maker space) serves employers.

Need #3: Respond to industry needs
Through the McClellan Innovation Center’s state-of-the-art facilities, and the expanded training capabilities it brings, we will increase the region’s ability to meet the needs of industry and prepare students and workers for jobs and careers in the growing Advanced Manufacturing sector.  Moreover, it is our hope that the cross-pollination of ideas and the synergy that will occur in this creative and flexible environment between employer and industry professionals, faculty, and students establishes the Center as a well-regarded regional institution, which further helps attract advanced manufacturing companies to the region.

"This proposal is a continuation of the previously approved multi-year Mobile High-Fidelity Simulation Center Project of FY2016-17.  This project represents a combination of services to improve the critical thinking, communication, computation, and work readiness skills for all Los Rios allied health and public safety students, and to provide local and regional health care and public safety partners with onsite access to state-of-the art high-fidelity simulation for their incumbent workforce.","The Mobile High-Fidelity Simulation Center Project (MHFSCP) is designed to meet the growing educational needs of all emergency healthcare and public safety students and employer partners in the Greater Sacramento area and the surrounding region. Several local and regional needs were identified prior to the development of the project design.  The primary needs of the project will be addressed below.  Given the dynamic nature of health care education, direct patient care, and public safety challenges, this list of needs is not exhaustive and may change throughout the life of the project and beyond. 
First, health care and public safety education is constantly changing.  The educational demands on students in these sectors continues to accelerate.  As a result, students must be exposed to more “life-like” scenarios or simulations to enrich their learning experience and enhance their skills competencies. These scenarios demand skills in team leadership, critical thinking, communication, and stress management. The MHFSCP provides students and employees with access to high-fidelity ‘patients’ with focused feedback in a managed stressful environment.  The ‘patients’ are actually human-like, computerized mannequins. Today, these simulators are the most technologically advanced training tools available to the medical community.  They can breathe, talk, and react to medication.  They can die.  However, unlike humans, these patients come back to life again and again. The MHFSCP will provide thousands of students and employees the opportunity to work directly with their local team members using this unique mobile learning platform.  No other mobile platform, similar to American River College’s MHFSCP exists in the region and will be the first of its kind west of Nebraska. 
These high-fidelity experiences also provide students and incumbent workers with more authentic assessments. Authentic assessments results in improved feedback and more robust work readiness for students. Authentic assessments also allow for defensible remediation and ongoing skills evaluations of the incumbent worker.  Most regional program advisory committees continue to challenge college faculty to improve the workplace readiness of their graduates.  The MHFSCP directly addresses this need by providing increased access to high fidelity scenarios specifically designed with these workplace skills in mind. Students are the center of this plan, a plan designed to ensure and maintain gainful employment. 
Second, access to critical clinical and field placements are declining in the region.  This decline is significantly impacting many guided pathways initiatives “more and better”, regional programs, CTE program enrollment growth, and ultimately a student’s success in finding middle wage jobs.  The need to find cost effective solutions addressing the lack of clinical access is another need addressed by the MHFSCP.  Frankly, many educational experts contend that increased access to high-fidelity simulations, have greater positive impacts to economically disadvantage students than many other student populations.  
One regulatory strategy, to overcome these placement limitations, has been to supplant required clinical hours with faculty led high-fidelity simulation lab hours.  For example, the State of California Emergency Medical Services Authority now allows for 25% of required clinical hours to be accomplished via high-fidelity simulation. The Bureau of Registered Nursing is currently considering increasing their allowance of high-fidelity clinical hours from 25% to 50%. The consequence of this regulatory shift has been an increasing demand for access to high fidelity simulators.  In many instances, access to these high-fidelity tools is non-existent or economically impossible. The MHFSCP begins to address the current and future needs of access to high-fidelity simulation as a secondary clinical or field lab resource.  By meeting this demand, programs can continue to work on increasing the number of students (skills builders included) who can enroll and complete the various health-related programs thereby increasing the quality and number of course completers, certificates, and degrees awarded. This effort directly impacts the Strong Workforce Recommendations number 2, 11, 17, 19, 20, and 25. 
Third, and closely related to the need previously addressed, is that college programs are being asked to expand and grow while access to quality clinical placements is increasingly limited.  For decades, the community colleges in the region have not been in a position to “give back” to our clinical/field partners.  “We provide you with future employees” has historically been the college response.  Currently, regional health care partners are under increasing pressure, from for-profit schools, to increase their clinical student access. These same for-profit schools are now paying institutions for clinical/field access.  Community colleges cannot compete with this financial reality. However, other competitive options are available to counter this trend. The MHFSCP will provide the college system an opportunity to showcase, in a very tangible way, the local and regional community college’s commitment to the health care and public safety sectors in the region. The MHFSCP is a proactive and innovative effort to address this substantial regional need. 
Finally, the MHFSCP will address these and several other identified needs as regional educational institutions, healthcare, and public safety employers from Yolo, Sacramento, El Dorado, and Placer counties schedule the mobile unit.  Access to the mobile unit will provide for real time, onsite, and cost-effective student or incumbent employee education without the high costs of traditional medical training and mandatory skills competency updates.
The additional benefits of the MHFSCP include:
•	Maintenance/increase in wage gains for multiple high wage earner groups
•	Standardized curriculum to assure uniform educational opportunities
•	An opportunity for students and medical personnel to test and practice their critical thinking reactions and skills, leading to a high degree of familiarity and confidence
•	Significant increase in FTES 
•	Improved access to high-fidelity simulation for campus-based student group.

The resources below will provide you with more information on Mobile High-Fidelity Simulation projects already in place in other states.  While many of these programs focus primarily on rural partners, the Los Rios project will combined both rural and urban partners.  Significant in kind contributions have already been secured to ensure the long-term viability of this project.

Continuation of the Project

With the mobile unit and high fidelity simulators already on order, this year’s proposal is to allow the continued work of the program consultant and other operational needs of the program. The consultant continues to develop the operational and long term business plan to ensure sustainability of the investment. The mobile unit is due to arrive near the end of the Fall 2018 semester. The high fidelity simulators will be delivered to the mobile unit vendor during the build out phase to ensure full integration. ",\n,\n,\n
"This project is a continuation of the Advanced Transportation Regional Share Project. In Year 2 & 3 of this project, ARC will continue to develop the program and acquire additional equipment for the mobile training lab. The district will complete a business plan that identifies the workforce skills training gaps in the advanced transportation sector and methods to reduce those gaps. Cosumnes River College and Sacramento City College will purchase equipment that address the identified gaps.","The advanced transportation sector is experiencing a shortage of skilled workers, in areas such as automotive technology, diesel mechanics, alternative fuels, air craft controllers, licensed SMOG inspectors, among other areas. Employers at a recent workforce symposium, hosted by Valley Vision, voiced concerns over finding qualified technical workers for open positions both now and in the future.",\n,\n,\n

The project provides professional grade equipment to train students on the type of equipment used by professional photographers in the field. It also provides support for a Photography Lab Technician that will allow students more access to the Photography Lab and support in using the equipment outside of instructional time.","This provides needed support to students through increased access to professional equipment (through the purchase of equipment and through increased staffing in the Photography Lab that will allow students more access to this equipment). The program will soon be housed in our new state of the art facility. For students to develop marketable skills in photography, they require access to these facilities that a full time Lab Technician can provide. This will also provide time for full time Photography faculty to develop stronger industry relationships to better connect students to job and internship opportunities. ",\n,\n,\n

"The project is intended to provide a K-12 Cybersecurity Competition Pathway into regional community colleges.","CyberPatriot is a national K-12 competition designed by the Air Force Academy Foundation. Teams of one-six K-12 students from across
the country compete virtually in a variety of areas that focus on hardening desktop and networking systems. Security topics addressed
include: Microsoft Windows Server, Microsoft Windows Desktop, Lynx, Cisco, accurate documentation and teamwork/collaboration. Teams
participate in sanctioned monthly practices and competitions year round with the official competition season October through January
(March if they are selected to go to the national competition). The first year Coastline hosted 26 teams with the help of Cypress. Last year
Coastline and Cypress hosted teams and Irvine Valley participated. For 2017 Coastline, Cypress, and Irvine Valley are hosting 219 teams
(up to 1,314 students) registered out of 5554 teams nationally . The plan is to add additional colleges each year first as a participant
followed by a full program the following year. The program not only develops cybersecurity/networking skills but also focuses on the
development of students as collaborators . CyberPatriot competitions builds awareness, skills, and self-confidence on the part of students
from different backgrounds and experiences many of whom may not have considered a STEM pathway. Competing and preparing for
competitions side by side with community college faculty helps to build pathways for students who many times have not considered a
community college option. As a result the colleges build awareness with students and their families, increase enrollments in cybersecurity
pathways, build skill sets that lead to increased transfer, and provide skills needed for job attainment.",\n,\n,\n

"Addressing California's severe teacher shortage has been a top priority in the CA Community Colleges. As we embark to align our education systems to develop pathways in high-demand STEM and CTE fields, we need to invest in education and teacher preparation to prepare educators with the 21st century skills necessary to work in education careers. The overarching goal of the project is develop a regional “Careers in Education” pathway(s) model with a particular focus on STEM and CTE.","The importance of growing a statewide network of STEM/CTE teacher education programs linked to Doing What MATTERS industry sectors in the LA region is vital to the success of the Strong Workforce Program initiative.
Teacher Shortage:  Labor Market Information and published reports indicate that there is a severe shortage of teachers across the state in high need areas such as STEM fields, and in Career and Technical Education (CTE). In a letter by LAEDC President & COO, David Flaks, in support of Senate Bill (SB) 436, a legislation that would help address the growing shortage of qualified science and math teachers, he noted that there will be a projected shortage of 33,000 teachers in math and science that will not be met over the next decade. LMI data from the California Employment Development Department identified an estimated 51,500 openings for elementary school teachers and 31,100 jobs for secondary school teachers statewide between 2010 and 2020; with K-12 teaching being one of the top 10 best paid occupations and having the highest number of job openings (82,600), second only to nursing (99,800).

Growing Demand in CTE and CTE Shortage:  The Bureau of Labor Statistics projected that the fastest growing careers would be in career and technical education (CTE) fields such as healthcare and trade and industrial occupations (2008- 2009 Occupational Outlook Handbook, Bureau of Labor Statistics). However, in order to prepare a workforce to fill these fast-growing and in-demand jobs, students will need training from quality secondary and postsecondary CTE teachers – resources that are severely lacking today.

There is no accurate estimate of the shortfall of CTE teachers in California due, in part, because districts haven’t been asked to include unfilled CTE positions in an annual fall teacher employment survey. However, several factors that are contributing to the worsening teacher shortage across the nation are also affecting CTE; the increased number of students enrolled in CTE courses resulting in more classes and demand for more teachers, the elimination of many existing teacher education programs, and the growing number of teacher retirements.

In California, this shortage is becoming a particularly dire issue as it faces high rates of retirement in its current teaching workforce while the demand for more CTE teachers, given the influx of funding for career pathways across CA in recent years (e.g., CA Department of Education’s California Career Pathways Trust to create pathways bridging into college focused on work-based learning), has been growing.

Importance of TPP programs in Community Colleges:  Transcript studies on the institutions attended by the nation’s current classroom teachers suggest that more than 50% attended a community college for at least part of their education. Community colleges often provide the only technology training and most of the general content area courses future teachers receive. It is estimated that four out of 10 teachers complete some of their math and science courses at community colleges.

Teacher Preparation Pipeline programs are critical to the development of career pathways throughout the California Community Colleges. California teacher education can also benefit from the diversity and faculty expertise of community college pathway programs, and from the alignment of K12, community college and university education pathways.

"Maintain increased capacity to assist Nursing students in successfully completing all requirements of the program in a timely manner, and to ensure that they are safe practitioners prior to their clinical experience in a hospital.","The demand for nurses continues to increase, and as such, the Nursing  program is receiving additional SWP funding to provide faculty tutors.  Providing this level of support is integral to maintaining increased numbers of students in this high-demand program (increased from 20 to 30 students admitted per semester).
Nursing requires the students to be proficient not only in theory but also in the clinical area.  Before entering any hospital setting the students go through rigorous testing, skill practice, skill demonstration and check-offs to provide the Instructors with the feedback to make the assessment if the student is a safe practitioner.  To get to this point the Nursing program has put into effect the Nursing Learning Center and its CA Board of Registered Nursing approved (under §1425 Faculty – Qualifications and Changes) assistant Instructors and clinical teaching assistants (or in other words faculty tutors) to help with this training.  The faculty tutor must be RN licensed, have an AS or BS Nursing degree and years of experience.  ",\n,\n,\n

\n,"Allan Hancock College fully implemented the use of high school grades into the assessment/placement process for math and English in fall 2018. A working group of faculty stakeholders, student services staff, and institutional effectiveness reviewed the model developed by the RP group. The math and English faculty made a few minor modifications to the GPA and course grade recommendations in the statewide model. In order to make the process as seamless as possible for students, the college is using self-reported data provided in CCCapply. ",\n,\n,\n
\n,"Beginning in March 2018, the college implemented the use of a new algorithm to place students using high school grades and GPA.  New students who provide their high school academic information (GPA and grades for the highest level of English and math they have completed) through CCCApply, will receive their placement information based on the information they submit. The college has a 7 year recency requirement for the use of HS academic information for placement. For English, placement will be determined based on HS academic records for students meeting the recency requirement. For math, students will be required to take the assessment test, but the higher of the placement results will be used. Students still have the ability to test or re-test. A process to provide new and continuing students (who did not submit high school GPA and grade information) an option to submit unofficial high school transcripts for the re-evaluation of their placement is under development (plan to implement in April 2018).",\n,\n,\n
\n,"In order to gain consensus on Multiple Measures, multi-discipline teams have been sent to state presentations and RP researchers have been brought on campus to present results from MM research.  In the past year, work teams lead by the Math and English Departments have been developing placement processes that will include high school grades.  These new processes will be in place for use in student placement in summer, 2018.

\n,"Increased efficiencies and decreased institutional barriers have been the result of a three-year implementation of multiple measures to place students where historically 80-84% of students placed into remedial coursework with very low success rates in the remedial sequence. This success occurs not only in student placement, but also in subsequent college-level coursework. Curriculum reform, redesigned accelerated remedial courses, innovative learning communities, and a seamless multiple measures approach for placing students in English and math courses have proven to be very successful in improving the numbers of students placed into college/transfer-level English and math at Bakersfield College.

BC’s previous policy change to use Multiple Measure over the past three years resulted in placement into the college-level English course increasing from 29% to 54% and college-level math from 3% to 34%. The success rate 3-year English completion went up from 69% to 77% and 59.9% to 68.8% for math; Bakersfield College has seen the largest gains in all categories among African American and Hispanic students.

For each individual student who comes in for Assessment, we collect information from forms that they fill out (self reporting method).  With the new change in legislation, we will be modifying the way we include high school grades into our process.  ",\n,\n,\n
\n,"Cabrillo has redesigned our assessment process to incorporate high school grades, and beginning Spring 2018 (for Summer/Fall registration) ALL students will receive a placement based on assessment test scores and high school data.  Students will receive the highest placement of either measure (assessment test score or high school data). 

We use the MMAP placement system where the assessment test raw score and high school performance are equal measures to calculate placement.  Basic criteria: a student must have completed 11th grade in a US high school.  
Criteria: For Both CalPass and self-report the rules are based on:
•	Cum HS GPA through 11th grade
•	Highest  English course completed 
•	Highest  Math class completed
•	Grades in those math and English classes

\n,"Cerritos College is piloting a process that places students based on their high school transcript data. The first phase of the pilot is nearly complete, in which more than 1000 students were assessed using the new placement process and the results have been impressive. Last year, using the Accuplacer assessment test, the college placed 18 percent of its new students in transfer level English. Using the transcript data and the matrices developed by the Multiple Measures Assessment Project (MMAP), 60 percent of new students are placing into transfer-level English. Similarly, last year, using the Accuplacer assessment test, the college placed 4 percent of new students into transfer level Math. Using the transcript data, the college has placed 29 percent of new students into a transfer-level math course.

At this point, the process involves student bringing their transcript and inputting the data into a form that then provides them with English/ESL, Math, and Reading placements. In the near future, the process will include transcript data pulled from Cal-PASS as well as a self-assessment portion for students who have been out of school for more than 10 years or who did not go to high in the US for more than 3 years. To prepare for these changes, the college is engaged in various professional development activities that are assisting instructors in adapting to the changes. ","We would like a list of local, state, and national leaders in Guided Pathways to invite as keynote speakers for events like our anticipated on-site Guided Pathways conference/workshop.

Because tracking tools for student use provides a challenge, it would help to hear about solutions developed at other colleges.

has aligned the assessment and placement process to the recommendations from the Multiple Measures Assessment Project (MMAP).
Using these recommendations, the Counseling, Math, and English departments developed a Multiple Measures Guide. The college began
collecting data to track placements in spring 2017 and will be working with our Institutional Researcher to begin evaluating that data for validation and improvement of the placement process. The college was an early participant in the statewide Common Assessment Initiative. In addition to the use of multiple measures to improve and maximize student placement, a focus on assessment preparation was fully implemented in 2015. Through the use of multiple measures the college has been able to maximize student placement in courses. The number of students
completing the assessment process has increased from 46% of students in 2014-15 to 63% of students in 2016-17. The college has been
collecting data on the use of multiple measures and subsequent placements since spring 2017 and is working with the Office of Institutional Research in evaluating.  Currently, the process is a manual application of the MMAP measures.  The college is additionally working on the automation of the application of the MMAP identified multiple-measures in placing students.  
Continue to work with Statewide Academic Senate to coordinate and collaborate on the approaches to and implementation of Guided Pathways to help the campuses to work through misconceptions and barriers that have the potential to delay progress.","
We addressed this in our self-assessment and I know that this is already on the radar of the Chancellor's Office and the GP Regional Coordinator, but I will re-state here.  It would be very helpful to have representation of successful Guided Pathways (even if it precedes or was not called Guided Pathways) from more of a variety of institutions, particularly smaller and more rural colleges. 

I believe that this is also already happening, but it would be very helpful to have the self-assessments reviewed for:
-themes
-cohorts of colleges by element (at similar points)
-opportunities for Chancellor's resources to develop for elements that are shown to be consistent gaps across the system
-core of a variety of approaches and college to share models of successful strategies

It would also be helpful for IEPI to provide professional development/training on project management.  Many of these efforts represent the need for a skill set in project management/program implementation.  Professional development, resources and templates for models of scaled project management would help to organize our efforts more effectively and completely.",\n,\n
\n,"Chabot College has been working for the past several years on evaluating assessment cut scores and implementing multiple measures for improved placement.  Both Math faculty and English faculty lowered cut scores for placement into College level courses.  They continue to evaluate cut scores, examining local and regional/national data.  English determined and is using high school GPA as another measure for placement.  Math determined high school course completion and GPA requirements as other measures for placement, and hosted several Math Summits with local high school math teachers to apply these measures in light of Common Core and Integrated Math. Chabot College established data sharing agreements with four (4) Career Pathway Trust partner school districts for secure data share.  ITS built a secure server system to evaluate high school transcript data and apply Multiple Measures automatically to determine student placement based on higher placement between Accuplacer score v. other high school course completion and/or GPA measures in Math and English.  This system was piloted in spring 2017 and fully implemented for fall 2017 for those 4 school districts.

-	How have other colleges designed pathways that support students with disabilities?
-	How have other colleges ensured that students don’t have to repeat coursework if they change majors/careers?
-	How have other colleges leveraged technology to support and inform students?
-	How have other colleges connected SEPs with enrollment management and scheduling?

\n,"San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD) & CCSF have worked for years to create multiple measure processes for High School (HS) seniors. The Bridge to Success Initiative has provided opportunities for students to use HS grades & attendance in English & Math courses as indicators of success. English & Counseling Departments both have multiple measures processes & collaborate to provide Basic Skills Eligibility Coordinators, Orientations & All-in-One Days. Our English, ESL & Math Departments have made huge strides toward sequence acceleration at CCSF over the last 5 years.
SFUSD, CCSF's Math Department, & the Office of Matriculation implemented a new math placement pilot project in which graduating seniors enrolling at CCSF in Fall 2012 could raise their test placement by meeting 2 of the following criteria: HS Math GPA of 2.7 or higher; HS attendance rate of 90% or greater; a score on the CST Math test of “Basic” or higher. For Fall 2012 enrollment, out of 1,400 applicants to the College, SFUSD identified 648 graduating seniors who met the aforementioned criteria. As a result, 276 first-semester CCSF students who had initially placed below college-level math on the CCSF placement test during their last year of HS received a “bump” in their CCSF math placement.

Since Spring 2013, the English Department has been developing criteria to supplement the current placement testing process. The department has also received research assistance from the Bridge to Success Partnership to identify SFUSD HS data that may serve as indicators of student preparation in an enhanced multiple measures placement process, similar to the Math placement “bump up” process.

Prior to AB705, basic skills leaders worked effortlessly to create accelerated paths to completion for students. Our English, ESL & Math Departments have all created new accelerated
assessment/placement sequences for students with goals to attain an associate degree and/or transfer. Faculty have participated in professional development activities at the local, state & national levels to gather & share research, best practices and expertise to help transform our assessment/placement processes to offer the most effective & validated multiple measures options for students in HS entering CCSF as well as new, re-entry, continuing and transfer students. We are in early conversations and look forward as to how the AB705 efforts coming forth will impact/align with our existing basic skills acceleration efforts.","As the largest single college district in the state, we would like to ask the CCCCO for site-specific technical assistance and capacity-building. CCSF could benefit from the bandwidth and expertise of trained facilitators. Even given the state allocation, given the size of CCSF, we will struggle with providing adequate release time for internal faculty and staff to take on this role of planning and facilitating large-scale and complex workshops for movement on guided pathways. Our hope is that those facilitators would be able to provide their services free of charge given that those entities are funded to
support this work.

Given that we anticipate a number of colleges will want to visit those colleges that are further along in their Guided Pathways work, we wonder whether CCCCO can help coordinate particular visit dates to minimize the disruption to those colleges that would host visits. All interested colleges could then potentially visit at the same time.

We also envisioned that a summit (panel) and/or debate featuring individuals from colleges that have been immersed in Guided Pathways work could be beneficial. This would be an opportunity to bring a number of colleges together at the same time to hear from each other about the pros and cons.

\n,"Since 2015, College of Alameda has participated as one of the pilot colleges in the Multiple Measures Assessment Project (MMAP) led by the RP Group and Educational Results Partnerships' Cal-PASS Plus system to develop, pilot, and assess implementation of a statewide placement tool using multiple measures. The College (via the District Office) has data sharing agreements with all of the major high school feeder districts in the region, allowing counselors access to high school transcript data for incoming students.  College of Alameda has applied the MMAP decision rules for placement in Math since 2015.  The College has made some modifications to its English placement rules by developing and implementing a new Writing Sample Assessment in 2017.  Early evaluations of the College’s MMAP initiative suggest that students are more likely to be placed and succeed in transfer level English and math than they would have been absent the high school transcript information.

As the College moves to update its decision rules to match those updated by RP Group and Ed Results Partnership in October, 2017, it is also considering the curriculum innovations it has implemented with the Basic Skills and Student Outcomes Transformation (BSSOT) grant.  New co-requisite support courses are being phased in as a result of BSSOT grant-funded efforts which will need to be added to the College’s decision rules.  

College of Alameda’s Admissions Office and Math Department are also developing a self-guided placement tool, based on the updated decision rules in math.  The College will pilot this tool in spring and summer 2018 for placement in fall 2018 math classes.  The College Office of Research and Planning will conduct A/B Testing on the tool to evaluate its effectiveness and any possible disproportionate impact on student sub-populations.

The College is anticipating greater access to high school transcript data from CalPass Plus once it is able to secure regular uploads of CalPads data from the California Department of Education.  This will allow the College to scale the number of students who can benefit from assessment and placement based on their performance in high school.

\n,"The English department at CCC used the MMAP rules as an act of faith in the numbers provided by the RP group.  The math department, however, were loosely based on Long Beach City College and the Career Ladders Project data that was available at the time.  At that point MMAP was just getting started.  We joined the MMAP project later (after our rules were created for math) so there are most likely parallels, but our work in math was not literally based on the MMAP rules.  Math adjusted the GPA cut levels to what made sense to the department.  In cooperation with our District Office IT department, we created an electronic tool similar to the one created at Sierra College.  Once created, in December 2016, we went live for both English and math.  Initially, students inputted all their high school data into tool that was designed for students to see what their placement would be even prior to applying to the college.  The students could then print that information and bring it to the Assessment Office.  For English this included both cum GPA and grade received in most recent English class (for direct matriculants).  For math this included, highest math course completed with grade received, score in AP if taken, score for CA Smarter Balanced Assessment, overall H.S. GPA, and major (for direct matriculants).  For nondirect matriculants in English the recommendation is based solely on cum GPA and for math the same information was used but with different cut scores.  We then added a second feature to the tool which was placed behind our portal and allowed enrolled students to submit their scores electronically to the Assessment Office once they applied to the college.  We don’t currently require submission of high school transcripts but strongly recommend it.  Now that we have been using the tool for a year, we have engaged with the District Research Office to take a look at our success rates and other data to see if any tweaks need to be made to the decision rules.  This is currently in process and will take some time to sort out.  As a District, we are also considering “turning on” the feature within CCCApply to accept high school transcript data on the application.  As a side note, we did attempt to use CalPass Plus data but found that we had trouble getting accurate data from our local partners.","1) Develop a website dedicated to best practices that are categorized by the 14 key elements.

The first cohort included students who graduated from the top feeder high schools in Spring 2016 and was enrolling in the College in Fall 2016. High school GPA was available from the CAL-Pass Plus website.  Instead of developing an algorithm for its students, the College partnered with Educational Results Partnership to use the algorithm that have been tested across the state. Initial cohort was assessed and placed for English and the scope was expanded to Mathematics subsequently. The initial learning experience exposed the need for modification of the software used by the counselors so that they can view the assessment and placement based on the traditional testing and high school GPA. Once the software was modified, the pilot was expanded from the feeder high schools to all incoming freshmen who graduated in Spring prior to enrolling in Fall. The next phase of the project is to expand the scope to all entering students.","An unintended consequence of using high school GPA for assessment and placement is implementing major modifications in scheduling practices. Participation in the lower level courses diminished significantly and the demand for seats in college-level courses increased.

","In order to achieve our student success goals and maximize the impact of our integration efforts, we have to shift our mindset to one that welcomes change. While we need support in making organizational change at a high-level, we also could benefit from specific technical support. Below, we describe specific areas in which we could benefit from additional support:
Organization-level practices that will enable change:
•	Change Management webinars: preparing and supporting individuals, teams, and organizations in making organizational change. 
•	Big Data Analytics training: techniques that provide a means of analyzing data sets and drawing conclusions about them to help us make informed business decisions.	
Goal setting and evaluation:
•	We would like to simplify the goal-setting process. To what extent should our institutional goals align with or integrate the system-wide Vision for Success?•We could benefit from more specific guidance on writing our goals in the context of how they will later be evaluated. We also want to make sure that the state will be able to provide us with the appropriate metrics to enable short-term, formative assessment, as well as a long-term, summative assessment of progress toward our goals.• Similarly, what is your vision for evaluating goals and how should we be preparing for future evaluation now? Is there a specific assessment timeline? Will we be looking at short-term outputs or long-term outcomes?
Eliminating equity gaps:
•The Chancellor’s Office articulated that we must eliminate equity gaps system-wide in 10 years. We would like guidance on how that should that be integrated into our institutional goals (e.g. must we adopt the same goal of no equity gaps in the same timeline?).Is the expectation that, by eliminating “equity gaps,” every demographic group will have the same success, persistence, and completion rates, or at least that each group’s individual rate be less than one margin of error away from the all-student rate? Alternatively, is it sufficient for all groups to meet a particular institution-set goal, even if some groups continue to outperform? We, of course, would like all groups to improve, but if that happens, then gaps will necessarily remain. Should we expect some groups’ performance to plateau, which would allow others to catch up? Are we instead chasing moving targets as all groups improve?",\n,\n

\n,"
The assessment process for math and English courses includes high school grades as one of the measures for placement directly into transfer level. A variety of academic and student supports are provided to increase success for the higher number of students in these courses. Curriculum has been redesigned to facilitate the ability of first-year students to complete transfer-level math and English in year one. 


","As individual college plans emerge and truly guided pathways systems are developed additional touch points and services will be required.  Our current funding formula does not allow for that level of support.  We would suggest a needs assessment as plans emerge at colleges for a more realistic funding approach for ensuring students successfully complete pathways.  Success of a large-scale redesign relies on the involvement of every level of the college, so we need adequate funding for full-time faculty, as well as staff and administrators. 

The regional networking and professional learning for guided pathways provided through IEPI has been helpful and should be scaled up. A model that could include state funding for regional leads to meet, plan professional learning for the region (in concert with IEPI), and hold events would support the colleges as they grapple with design and implementation challenges.",\n,\n
\n,"The college has adopted RP Group recommended MMAP decision rules in math and English, using them disjunctively with our pre-existing test-based assessment and placement method. That is, a placement is determined for each student in two ways: (1) based on the pre-existing placement scheme, which relies on an assessment test as well as high school academic history; and (2) based on the MMAP decision rules, which rely on high school GPA and course grades (self-reported, at this point). The placement the student receives is the higher of these two placements (i.e., disjunctive logic).
 
It is important to note that we have fully automated the new MMAP assessment and placement at full scale (as of late July 2017). Though it is still too early for meaningful results regarding student success in connection with the new placement protocol, we have seen that over half of a sample of approximately 800 students placed higher in math after the new MMAP implementation than they would have before. Our next steps include continued evaluation of impacts of the new placement protocol, as well as working to incorporate Cal-PASS Plus data verification (where available) in an automated fashion at full scale.
","(1) We have found the IEPI workshops on Guided Pathways useful. Having more of those would be helpful, particularly if they can be focused on specific aspects of Guided Pathways implementation and include time for us to work with a facilitator on planning (e.g., the team time with facilitator to work on work plans at the Pomona workshop on February 20 was particularly fruitful).
 
(2) Incorporating more national experts into the professional development to help guide our discussions and planning will likely be helpful. We have much to learn from Guided Pathways efforts across the country, and integrating first hand insights from those efforts would be a good addition.
 
(3) A major concern is how new Common Core integrated math curriculum will impact the validity of the MMAP decision rules recommended by the RP Group. These rules were developed based on years of data from students that took high school math in California prior to Common Core implementation. Mapping academic histories in the new integrated math curriculum onto these decision rules is a non-trivial empirical question that individual colleges are not equipped to answer. We need significant guidance on this issue as soon as possible.

This will be beneficial especially for members of the Guided Pathways Steering Committee and the Student Equity Access and Success Committee to explore which aspects of Guided Pathways will most benefit LAMC students. In addition, the Chancellor’s office may consider reviewing the application process via CCCApply for new students to revise it to one page/screen. The length of time that it currently takes prospective students to apply through CCCApply is lengthy and may contribute to the high number of incomplete applications.

\n,"LATTC began working with the Multiple Measures Assessment Project (MMAP) in Fall 2016.  Students taking the Accuplacer assessment test answer a series of student background questions that take into consideration highest course completed in Math and/or English and the students’ high school GPA. This is all student reported data, as the college does not have any data sharing agreements in place with surrounding feeder K-12 school districts.
 
Faculty from Math and English have been involved from the beginning in developing the criteria and placement model for each area respectively. For LATTC we have adopted a placement model that  allows students to place a maximum of two levels above their Accuplacer test score (with MMAP) in both Math and English.",\n,\n,\n
\n,"Assessment/placement test reform has been an ongoing project through the College’s Basic Skills Initiative since 2007, where we have continued to work toward improving the accuracy of the placement process. Over the years, we have developed videos, materials, and a website to help inform and prepare students for the placement test while the College was still using the standardized test method with Accuplacer. In Spring 2015, the College began to collaborate with Multiple Measures Assessment Project (MMAP) team by hosting workshops on campus and at Opening Day to share with faculty the benefit of using high school grades/GPA to place students. Then with administrative support and faculty-buy in in Spring 2016, we fully implemented the recommended MMAP placement protocols for all incoming students taking the placement test. Because we had challenges with obtaining accurate and timely high school transcript information from LAUSD, we decided to use students self-reported high school grades. That is, our assessment protocol has students report high school transcript information through a survey that is tied to the MMAP algorithm. The students then take the Accuplacer test for math and English. The higher placement value whether it is through the high school grades or Accuplacer is used to place students in their math and English courses.  Although the sample size is small in terms of semesters of analyzed data, the results are promising: MMAP placement for English resulted in a 17% increase of students placing into English 101 (27% versus 45%). The number of students completing transfer level English increased by 25% (416 to 522). MMAP placement for Mathematics resulted in 24% increase of placement into transferable math (4% versus 28%). The number of students completing transfer level math increased by 184% (89 to 253).  
As the College moves forward with Guided Pathways and the implementation of AB 705, we will be using the data captured thus far to inform our strategy by streamlining the assessment process and developing co-requisite support systems for students with lower GPAs. 
","The college would be interested for the Chancellor's Office to provide direction towards colleges with established effective Guided Pathway models. Professional development guidance wherein college constituents are not required to attend a conference as well as an online depository of good practices would be helpful.

\n,"Lake Tahoe Community College has historically included high school grades as part of the multiple measures assessment and placement process for both English and math.  However, AB705 requires a new focus on high school math and English course completion and overall high school GPA as a primary component of the placement process. The College stopped requiring English assessments for students during the 2016-17 academic year and has moved to a rubric utilizing previous academic performance, including high school grades, as a primary placement tool. The counseling faculty have recently been discussing similar approaches to the math placement process. Counselors from the College and the local high school have met to determine high school and college math course equivalencies. The Dean and counseling faculty have reviewed the Mathematic Placement Models for the Multiple Measures Assessment Project in an effort to develop a placement rubric for math. This process has resulted in a preliminary rubric using high school math coursework and cumulative high school GPA as primary placement indicators. The Lead Counselor has received approval from the Math Department Chair to pilot this new rubric with local high school seniors enrolling for the Fall 2018 term.  Placement and outcome data will be reviewed for this pilot group compared with students who were not part of the group. The math and counseling departments will be reviewing data from this pilot project to assess the rubric, accuracy of placement, and success rates. This review will evaluate the effectiveness of the pilot model and prompt necessary adjustments before implementation of a new placement process is fully implemented","Because so many colleges nationally and around California have been designing and implementing Guided Pathways for longer than we have at LTCC, we would like guidance and research from the Chancellor's Office around best practices. We are committed to a Guided Pathways Framework that works for LTCC and LTCC students; however, we would like to avoid reinventing the wheel, particularly because, as a small school, we have limited human resources and bandwidth.  This might involve the sharing of information about the values of specific career and transfer pathways and marketing resources for sharing that information with students. It might also mean gathering together best practices around on-boarding programs, like first year experiences or seminars for communities of interest. We are interested in learning from the experiences of other colleges further down the Guided Pathways path, and would value on-site assistance from other colleagues further along in the process. Additionally, support from the Chancellor's Office in terms of data integrity and the accurate collection and analysis of data will be vital. As a small college but also a quarter school, the statistical significance is challenging, given small data sets, and quarter-based numbers don't always correspond clearly to semester numbers. Technical support for the collection and management of data will be useful to LTCC.",\n,\n
\n,"Due to the state's most updated call for the implementation of Multiple Measures in the assessment and placement process, our campus is currently examining the newly released chancellor's office memorandum about AB705 that was released on Thursday, March 22. We are aware that high school grades -- within the last ten years -- are now the standard for placing students into courses that will accelerate their success in transfer-level math, ESOL and English.

Currently, our district-wide, state-approved assessment for placement in math, ESOL and English is paired with high school G.P.A. and guided self-placement from our counseling team to help students place into whatever the highest level of math, ESOL or English is for them. We are anxious to learn more about how to implement the new changes and want to ensure we are in compliance with the new law. We are also invested in this work because of our Basic Skills Success Outcomes and Transformation Grant in English and Math, which is already doing intentional work around eliminating unnecessary barriers for students and ensuring they are completing transfer-level coursework within a reasonable timeframe. We also believe this work is intentionally aligned with the efforts of our colleagues who are working in SSSP and equity to minimize achievement gaps and maximize positive student outcomes.","The question indicates this is optional; however, the form does not allow for not inserting a response.",\n,\n
\n,"The inclusion of high school grades into the English and math assessment process was made more than a decade ago as part of the multiple measures criteria.  High school grades were weighted significantly higher in the English assessment process beginning in March of 2016 and in the math assessment process beginning in October of 2017.","Based on the amount of work that needs to completed?, it would be appreciated if additional funding could be allocated to the colleges for Guided Pathways.   There is a concern the current level of funding may not be enough to fully implement Guided Pathways.  In addition, it would be great if the Chancellor's Office could provide more training opportunities for colleges to learn about best practices with regarding to implementing Guided Pathways.",\n,\n
\n,"Lassen College uses multiple measures when placing high school students into our classes. All of our high school students take the Accuplacer test as one measure. To determine appropriate math placement we take into consideration the high school course and grade in conjunction with the assessment test results. In regards to the Automotive discipline, Lassen College has determined to use our assessment scores and the student’s 10thEnglish grade. We also may take into account the use of SAT/ACT, ERWC (Expository Reading and Writing Course), EAP (Early Assessment)/CAASPP (California Assessment of Student Performance and progress), and Advanced Placement scores when determining the appropriate placement of a high school student.","Establish peer to peer professional development opportunities among small rural college districts.

\n,"The College is currently utilizing multiple measures (senior year) in it's assessment and placement process for math, English, and reading for partner districts (i.e., Long Beach, Bellflower, Paramount). Starting in fall 2018 the goal is for the College to utilize self-reported high school transcript data from CCCApply as a primary predictor for assessment and placement for all other students, in alignment with AB 705. ","The College believes that consistent professional development pertaining to guided pathways for constituent groups would be most helpful. In the beginning stages, the campus needs professional development to establish urgency and understanding to move forward implementation. As the campus moves into initial stages of implementation, further knowledge of roll out and communication strategies would be beneficial. Presentations, webinars, and articles about the guided pathway framework, expectations, defined aspects, collaboration/integration of other funding sources and projects would all be helpful to communicate information pertaining to guided pathways to the campus community. 

Information on how other colleges are progressing on certain elements would be beneficial. Particularly, recommendations from the Chancellor’s Office and knowledge of how other colleges are engaging in cross-functional inquiry (i.e., engaging in broad, deep, and inclusive discussion and inquiry about the guided pathways approach), scaling applied learning opportunities, and building technology infrastructure to support guided pathways would assist the college’s progress on these elements. This appears to be happening with the upcoming IEPI Peer-to-Peer Work Plan Reading Circle, but as implementation progresses it would be helpful to have more opportunities like this. Further, professional development is needed to inform how to meaningfully integrate all college-wide plans into the guided pathways framework and systematically move the goals of all plans forward in a coordinated manner as guided pathways is implemented.

\n,"In April of 2016 Merritt participated as a pilot college for the state’s Multiple Measures initiative. Multiple Measures and the Improve Placement Tool (which was developed by Peralta Institutional Research Department) were and continue to be used to the present day based on the adopted MMAP placement rules to high school transcript data received from Oakland Unified School District, Berkeley Unified School District and Alameda Unified.  
The files along with original transcripts are located on the CounselorShare drive (W drive) along with placement recommendations for each student based on the high school GPA.  Counselors can search by the name of the student to see their recommended placement based on the adopted decision rules based on the high school GPA.  Counselor compare these results with the assessment scores and recommend the higher placement. 
For students who attended a school other than AUSD, BUSD or OUSD counselors are still able to use the Improved Placement Initiative Tool to recommend the appropriate placement as long as a student has their unofficial high school transcript. 
Problems arose with the MMAP pilot in that after we received the initial set of transcripts from the district in 2016, there was a hiatus in receiving subsequent high school transcripts.
We have a large number of students who are not recent high school graduates. In those cases, it is much harder for students to obtain their high school transcripts nor do they want to go through the additional trouble of having to locate that information to return at a later time for placement and delayed class advisement.
An ongoing problem that is glaring for us is that when students opt to take the assessment and use high school transcripts, students often do not chose the higher placement. A very large number express their concern about low skill level and having forgotten their English and math skills and don't want to go for the higher level, even if we explained to them that there would be support classes, like Engl 208 and free tutoring.
The bottom line is that students are encouraged to bring in high school transcripts for placement recommendations based on the improved placement initiative tool. Sometimes students decide to go with the recommended higher placement, particularly for English, but often do not for math.","As many opportunities as possible to see what success looks like at colleges that are similar in size and complexity to Merritt College.  These can be done electronically. 
From a curriculum perspective, how do non-credit and basic skills fit into Guided Pathways?  We can see it as a key element, however; there seems to be push to phase out developmental education (e.g., AB 705). ",\n,\n
\n,"In November 2015, MiraCosta College moved from a model of placing students in English via standardized testing and high school GPA to a new multiple measures placement method that uses Guided Self-Placement. In the new model students meeting a specific GPA: self-selected a course level based on information about how best to complete the transfer level English requirement, were exempt from taking the COMPASS test, and were eligible for placement directly into transfer-level English. As a result of these initial changes, 71 percent of students were placed into transfer-level English (14 percent more than the old model). Latino/a students, who represent the largest portion of students placed under the new model, experienced the greatest gains, with 20 percent more students placed into transfer-level English. Nearly every ethnic group saw a significant increase in transfer-level placements under the new model. The college also evaluated the effects of these changes on course success. During the first round of data collection (spring 2016 and fall 2016), the success rate of students placed into English 100 via multiple measures was 79 percent, while the students placed via eCOMPASS succeeded at a rate of 69 percent. With the discontinuation of COMPASS in spring 2017, adjustments have been made to aid student understanding that they are self-selecting their course level through a process of considering multiple measures recommendations and reading information about each course level within the composition sequence. 

In February 2016, the Math Department also developed new placement guidelines for incoming students that utilized MMAP recommendations. The new guidelines leverage students’ high school GPA and previous math grades to determine placement in the math curriculum. Students who place below transfer utilizing this methodology are directed to the MDTP placement exam. A disjunctive model allows students to be placed at the highest placement of the two assessment methods. With 2014 placements as the historical baseline, the college analyzed the new model. Using the disjunctive approach, fewer students were placed into two and three levels below (41 percent) as compared to the previous model (49 percent). The 8 percent difference between the old and new models is spread between both the one level below and transfer-level course. While transfer-level placements increased from 33 to 35 percent, placements one level below increased from 19 to 25 percent. ","The resources that have been provided thus far through the CCCCO and those that are coming will be helpful.  We also wanted to share some thoughts about our participation in the California Guided Pathways Project and the extraordinary benefit that has provided to us in our guided pathways work.  The format of the six topical institutes that occur over the equivalent of two full days includes informational sessions by people knowledgeable about the implementation of guided pathways, numerous team time sessions with directed work on action plan sections, and dedicated coaches for each college team.  Each institute covers a different topic related to guided pathways design and implementation and the college teams that attend may vary depending on the institute topic.  The product of the institutes is an action plan that is taken back to the colleges for input and eventual implementation.  In between the institutes there are calls with coaches, and webinars during longer stretches that cover relevant topics.  The key benefits from participating in these institutes is the direct communication of knowledge from experienced practitioners, the assistance of coaches, the focused team time to have in depth discussions on important pathways elements and action plan items, and the opportunity to learn from, and collaborate with, colleagues from other colleges who are experiencing similar triumphs and challenges.  It would be great if the CCCCO would consider a similar model for the state’s guided pathways work.

The other thing that would be helpful is some training that is focused on change leadership.  Guided pathways work is transformational and college leaders are not always prepared to tackle the level of change that is needed to develop a sustainable approach and structure.  Again, this is not something that can be addressed in a one-off workshop. The opportunity to engage in a series of discussions and/or interactions that are focused on key aspects of change leadership and then to put them into practice with mentors to assist would be invaluable.",\n,\n
\n,"The multiple measure assessment pilot is underway with a small cohort. There have been some anticipated technical issues automating the use of high school grades as a placement measure. We are currently working with CalPASS and IS to resolve these issues. The RP Group has requested that colleges implement an ESL survey to test its efficacy as a possible multiple measure. Mission College is taking a leadership role in creating translation sheets in the ten most common languages among ESL populations in California to ensure equity in ESL placement. Thanks to the BSSOT grant for funding these translations. DSPS is looking to increase its basic skills course offerings to ensure our students are properly supported as AB 705 is implemented. Math is working on curriculum redesign in response to AB 705. English has already written and piloted new curriculum and will be scaling up our accelerated course offerings in Fall 2018. We are well ahead of other colleges in addressing AB 705 across all critical areas, but there remains much work to do in this area and we are just now beginning to receive information about the implementation committee regarding future guidelines from the state.","1. Revision of existing courses and programs and development of new programs will form the basis of much of the work that Mission College will do over the new 5 years to create our Metamajors and align our curriculum with the goals of the Guided Pathways Initiative. A lot of work has been done in the Chancellor’s Office to streamline the curriculum review and approval process, but all the colleges could greatly benefit from additional resources to accelerate the ongoing work on the State Curriculum Inventory.
2. A great deal of our work will also depend on having access to accurate MIS data, but currently the colleges are also hampered by regulations that do not allow for fast implementation of corrections to codes (e.g. TOP and SAM Codes) that have been identified through the Code Alignment Project and other efforts. We request support from the Chancellor’s Office to develop a fast-track process that will facilitate the entry of these corrections into the State Curriculum Inventory as well as the MIS database.
3. Mission College has adopted an inclusive approach that includes active involvement across constituencies. As such, we are treating our Classified Senate as an additional “Signatory Group” to our planning efforts, and wish to formally acknowledge the additional signature of our Mission College Classified Senate President, Brian Goo. Mission would welcome the opportunity to have future updates include a section within the digital form to add this signature.",\n,\n

\n,"Moreno Valley College’s initial implementation of MMAP began in Spring 2016, prior to the passing of AB705, as part of MVC’s participation in the statewide Multiple Measure Assessment Pilot.  The college focused its MMAP efforts on new, incoming direct matriculants who could both self-report on their high school GPA and grades in the highest level of math and English taken in high school and verify the report with an academic transcript. Using MMAP, a team assessed 804 students, 81 of whom were students enrolled in the college’s FYE program. 

This initial cohort of students showed significant improvement in placement into college-level mathematics and English:

	                                    MMAP 	Accuplacer Alone
College Level Mathematics	      36%	          1%
College Level English	              64%	         10%

In addition, outcomes analysis of students placed using MMAP from Spring 2016 through Spring 2017 indicate that success rates for students placing into college-level English are the same as those student who had previously been placed with Accuplacer. In mathematics, the success rate of students fell slightly for those students placed with MMAP, though this may have been due to an error in the implementation of the college MMAP mathematics placement matrix. This error has since been corrected and the expectation moving forward is that success rates should be at least what they had been using Accuplacer. Moreover, significantly more students in this cohort were able to complete college level mathematics than under the previous placement model.  

Since the initial implementation, MMAP guidelines were programmed into the district testing instrument and MVC decided to expand the MMAP assessment from only first-time direct matriculants to all students, expanding the cohort to 1,300 students. For both math and English, MMAP marks a dramatic difference, enabling students to enroll into a transfer-level course sooner than they would have otherwise. These increases in transfer-level placement in both English and math are hoped to translate into more students successfully completing transferable courses by Spring 2018 and support the decrease of time-to-degree, time-to-certificate, time-to-transfer, and altogether time-to-completion.
","The college workgroup had questions related to the following areas:
•	Creating effective cross-functional teams to work on guided pathways implementation;
•	The leadership structures that have been effective at colleges that have more fully implemented guided pathways;
•	Creating or co-creating clear vision for guided pathways at a community college;
•	Beyond the key performance indicators that are being tracked for guided pathways what other data has been informative in the implementation and ongoing development of guided pathways;
•	College alignment of resources (space, time, funds, and personnel) to support guided pathways;
•	Effective communication strategies to reach on- and off-campus stakeholders about guided pathways;
•	Case studies of how guided pathways have been implemented at the three California Community Colleges that are part of the AACC Pathways Project (Bakersfield College, Irvine Valley College, and Mt. San Antonio College).

\n,"The Mt. San Antonio College English and Mathematics and Computer Science Departments, after considerable research and discussion, made the decision to drastically change the assessment and placement process for all English and math courses.  Starting in Summer 2018, students will be placed primarily based on high school grades and coursework.  Both new students as well as current students will have an opportunity to be placed with the new assessment and placement process.  

In English, according to projections from the Research department, approximately 70% of students will place into transfer-level English based on high school metrics.  In addition, English faculty developed a corequisite support class for students who have lower high school GPAs so that students can place directly into transfer-level English if they enroll in the linked, 1-unit support course.  This means an additional 11% of students are projected to place into transfer-level English with a linked corequisite support course.  This is a huge shift as only 15% of students currently place into transfer-level English and under the new placement parameters, 81% of students will place into transfer-level English. The English Department has also developed an accelerated, one-semester course that is one level below transfer.  Approximately 13% of students will have the opportunity to take this course.  

The decisions made by the Math and Computer Science Department reflect similar changes in placement.  Early projections indicate that 61% of students would place into transfer-level math or higher, 24% would place one level below transfer, and 15% would place at two or more levels below transfer.  Currently, only 30% of students place into transfer-level math or higher.  Similarly, the Mathematics Department has written four corequisite support classes that enable students to progress even more quickly through the math sequence.  

The decision to primarily consider high school grades and coursework in placement into English and math courses is going to vastly increase students’ access to program-level coursework with prerequisites which in turn will enable them to complete degree, certificate, or transfer requirements much more quickly.

\n,"Statewide initiatives, notably the Basic Skills Initiative (BSI) and the California Acceleration Project (CAP) profoundly influenced the faculty dialog and produced significant curricular changes, especially in the English pre-collegiate sequence. English now has only one pre-collegiate course required, Accelerated English, and new curriculum is being piloted that would give students the option of taking a pre-collegiate co-requisite course along with college level English. Along with these curricular changes, adjustment of cut scores combined with multiple measure assessments have greatly increased the numbers of students able to begin in college level English. 

As a result of the most recent validation and disproportionate impact study in English, the College has begun to accept alternatives for placement recommendations. In January 2017, the English department approved the use of multiple measures. The Board of Trustees approved this measure in August 2017 to allow students to waive the assessment test or to adjust their current placement/assessment if they meet the specific criteria outlined below:
• For Transfer level (ENGL 101):
Completion of 11th grade and overall high school GPA >= 2.5 OR Completion of 11th grade and Non-Remedial, Senior-level English course with B- or higher OR Appropriate Assessment
• For ENGL 094 (Which allows students to take ENGL 101):
Completion of 11th grade and overall high school GPA >= 2.0 OR Completion of 11th grade and Non-Remedial, Senior-level English course with C or higher OR Appropriate Assessment

\n,"During spring 2017, MMAP was fully implemented for all incoming students.  Although this appears to be full-scale adoption, due to the newness of this method one-year outcomes have not been gathered and so Scaling in Progress is our current phase of adoption.

MMAP is relatively new but there have been encouraging outcomes for placement and course success to date.   At present, MMAP has shown phenomenal impact in shortening the time it takes for students to successfully transition to transfer-level English and math.  In the chart below, transfer-level placement is compared between MMAP and traditional placement.  As can be seen by comparing the blue and orange bars, the ratio of students that place at transfer-level in English, math and reading have increased dramatically, sometimes as much as ten times the percentage of traditional methods.  Also, in an analysis of student subgroups, all groups experienced this dramatic elevation into transfer-level courses.  Finally, in following students into the courses taken immediately after placement, no significant difference was found in student success rates when comparing MMAP students to those placed by traditional means.  This is great news since it indicates that MMAP is not placing students higher than their ability to perform successfully at transfer level.

The English Department approved the use of the state-wide MMAP model for both direct and non-direct matriculants. The Math Department, however, approved a modified version of the state-wide MMAP model for direct matriculants and it is currently working on developing a modified version of the state-wide MMAP model for non-direct matriculants. The MMAP models are intended for students who are less than 10 years removed from high school. Students who graduated from high school more than 10 years ago will be directed to “alternative placement”  or the placement test. 

The campus is working on creating an automated process with the support of District IT. In the meantime, the Office of Institutional Effectiveness will send a list of applicants to Cal-PASS Plus on a daily basis. The returned file will be modified to fit our local placement model for math. The OCC Assessment Center will use the placement list to enter and notify students of their placement recommendations based on the Cal-PASS Plus data. Students who were not matched via Cal-PASS Plus will also receive a notice from the Assessment Center asking them to complete a placement form, which includes self-reported information related to placement. Please note: students who complete a placement form will need to submit a high school transcript (official or unofficial) for verification. All students, who receive placement recommendations of pre-transfer level courses, will receive additional information related to placement improvement via alternative placement or the placement test.

The tool identifies the CTE pathways in the Orange County high schools and aligns them to their community college pathway matches.","What is the issue?
Presently, the manner and systems whereby graduating high school students can determine how to continue their CTE pathway studies at the community college level is, with some exceptions, marginal at best. They, their parents and their counsellors are often poorly informed of the options available.  

What does this tool do?
The CTE Crosswalk Pathway Tool identifies all the CTE pathways in the Orange County high schools and aligns them to their possible pathway matches in Orange County’s nine community colleges and North Orange Continuing Education. 

Who is developing this tool?
The very first iteration of the crosswalk was developed in 2016 by the Centers of Excellence, the data technical assistance providers for the California Community College ‘Doing What Matters’ framework.  

At the request of the Community College Chancellor’s Office and Kathy Booth of WestEd, this effort was revitalized starting in January 2017.  The OC Pathways and Orange County Dept. of Education, under the leadership of Amy Kaufman, Executive Director for OC Pathway accepted this challenge and tasked Steven Glyer, Consultant for Workforce Development to lead this effort.  The OC Pathways and OCDE provided the funding for this phase of the project.  Both the California Department of Education and the California Community College Chancellor’s Office are informed and supportive of this initiative. 

Since the basic crosswalk is now complete, the project is ready to enter Phase III, implementation.  

How is the alignment done?
In K12, CTE pathways are organized into 15 industry sectors such as Business & Finance or Marketing, Sales and Service.  These are further broken down into 58 specific pathways such as Child Development, Animal Science or Game Design and Integration.  All CTE courses in a sequence at a school site are assigned into a specific pathway.  Each of these pathways is assigned a code number.  For example, the Game Design pathway is assigned Code 114.  
In the community colleges, they organize their CTE programs by TOP codes.  TOP stands for Taxonomy of Programs.  These are six-digit codes.  The first two digits are like the 15 industry sectors in K12.  They are broad, such as Information Technology or Health.  The next four digits are similar to the K12 pathway codes.  So for example, in TOP code 06 – Media and Communications, the four-digit TOP code 0602 is Journalism, 0604 is Radio and Television, etc.

Are these exact matches?
No.  We believe that career development in the K12 world is foundational. This is where students are beginning to explore what they want to do with their lives.  But knowing exactly what path they will finally take occurs later in their education.

It is in the college world that students dive deeper into careers.  So the foundational high school pathway may have a variety of possible college pathways. Thus this crosswalk was designed to go from the specific to the broad.  For example, a student in the K12 pathway 196 – Biotechnology might consider continuing their career development into TOP Code 0403 – Biotechnology and Biomedical Tech or TOP Code 0934, Electronics (Biomedical Instrument) or TOP Code 1201 – Health Occupations, General.

How did you decide what matched what?
All of the K12 pathway codes have a program descriptor.  This descriptor is a short one, two, or three paragraph description of what the career pathway matches.  In the TOP Codes, the descriptors are not as extensive but do provide a good enough description to allow us to perform a match.

How might this tool be used?
For K12 districts to receive federal Perkins funding, all districts must identify and report their CTE programs by pathway codes.  This is very useful, as all CTE courses must be placed into state standardized buckets.

To measure the success of CTE programs, a system that is now included in all student information systems that identifies when a student completes two courses in a pathway sequence.  This is an important technical advancement, as it can be used to auto-generate a message to the student, his/her parents, counsellor? and pathway teacher.  

How this message is delivered, whether it be paper or electronic, sent out via text message, is available on a smart-phone or home computer is all in development.  In Orange County, all 15 districts with CTE programs use the Aeries Student Information System.  Discussions have been held with Aeries about collaborating in using the Crosswalk tool with their system. Aeries views such a collaboration as a significant enhancement to their service and has agreed to engage in its development. 

How will the community college part of the tool be enhanced?
As a student, parent or counsellor is informed of the possible opportunities for further education, what will be shared with them has a broad range of possibilities.  But almost all want to know the answers to these eight key questions.
1.	What are my career options?
2.	What are the education paths to those options?
3.	Where are these programs located in Orange County?
4.	What will I need to take?
5.	How long will it take?
6.	How much will it cost?
7.	How much financial aid can I get?
8.	Will my credits transfer?

We have also been in discussions with a developer of a smart-phone app called “Here to Career.” This is a joint effort of the Young Invincibles organization and the Foundation for the Community Colleges.  The app was designed to give answers to some of these key questions but delivered in a way that today’s millennials respond to, social media.   We see that their work may be closely connected to the Crosswalk alert system, which may make it capatable for combining the strengths of both efforts. 

Beyond this, we are confident that other strategies and collaborations will develop.  There are other data and strategic planning tools beyond Here to Career in which the CTE Pathway Crosswalk tool might well integrate into.  These might include such tools as MyPath, MyBestBets, California College Guidance Systems, Career Coach, etc.

And finally, there is a tight alignment with the state and national Guided Pathways movement.  These include the newly funded $150M Guided Pathways initiative of the Chancellor’s Office as well as the national effort of the AACC.

"We have introduced a form of Washington State’s Integrated Basic Education Skills Training (I-BEST) model into four CTE program introductory courses. Pharmacy Technician was the first program to develop and implement the SCE noncredit I-BEST model, where we pair a CTE instructor with an academic support instructor. This model helps students get the help they need while studying in the career field of their choice to help accelerate their progression of developing career 2 readiness skills.","The Pharmacy Technician program prepares students for an entry-level position as a pharmacy technician at a community and institutional pharmacy. The certificate exceeds the State Board of Pharmacy’s registration requirements and meets American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) accreditation standard.

In CTE, we have introduced a form of Washington State’s Integrated Basic Education Skills Training (I-BEST) model into four CTE program introductory courses. Pharmacy Technician was the first program to develop and implement the SCE noncredit I-BEST model, where we pair a CTE instructor with an academic support instructor. This model helps students get the help they need while studying in the career field of their choice to help accelerate their progression of developing career-to-readiness skills so they can move quickly into a living wage job. Student outcomes data demonstrates increased student success in I-BEST classes. To scale this academic support model beyond our introductory classes, SCE proposed to hire instructional assistance for the pharmacy technician capstone courses. Currently, there are SCE instructional assistants for the ESL, High School Diploma, Learning Center, and Business Skills and Computer labs, as well as Disability Support Services (DSS) classes. The SCE Pharmacy Technician Program is accredited by an industry recognized accrediting body with a significant lab component. In our self-study, one of the areas identified by faculty and students for improvement is insufficient academic support for students in the lab environment. This plan provides additional support for faculty to increase integration of academic support and career training within the lab environment.

Additional evidence to support this need is from our 2015-2016 Perkins Core Indicator report. The report states the following: There were 231 concentrators for academic year 2012-2013. The cohort consisted of students who passed three courses. We found 52.8% of concentrators completed their Pharmacy Technician Certificate Program. The rate falls below the state target for completion for the Pharmacy Technician Certificate Program. It should be noted that ten students who started in the Pharmacy Technician Certificate Program ended up with either another CTE certificate, ESL academic success certificate or received a high school diploma from the School of Continuing Education. Of the concentrators, 90.2% of students who did not graduated completed seven or more classes. The students who did not complete the program struggled in classes Pharmaceutical Mathematics, Pharmacy Operations Lab, Out-Patient Lab and In-Patient Lab. In some cases the students had to take the classes several times to pass or did not pass at all. 

If funded for a second year, the lab will be able to maintain the instructional assistants to continue to provide additional hands-on and academic assistance in a clinical lab setting. This type of setting requires dividing students up into small work groups with various simulation exercises. Some may be working on special equipment in the smaller lab area and other groups working on projects or practicing their skills to get ready for their turn in the special equipment areas, such as filling IV’s and using the laminar hoods. 

This proposal will continue to ensure an increase in the quality of our program, by providing students with more opportunities to practice their lab skills and get additional instructional assistance and support for increased course completion and retention. The pharmacy program has both a morning and evening set of course offerings, therefore, we are proposing to maintain the two (2) 50% Instructional Assistants hired through year one funding to continue ensure availability for all lab sections.

Additionally, to continue with our effort of ensuring all students have access to and an opportunity to industry certifications that leads to greater chance of employment, we would continue purchasing vouchers for the Pharmacy Technician Certification Board Exam (PTCB) and practice exams for a second year to gather sufficient evidence and data to show successful outcomes.

"This second (2nd) year of funding will allow us the opportunity to continue to build the infrastructure and resources needed to scale up some of the regional AEBG best practices in Workforce Development by expanding access to underserved populations within the NOCE CTE programs as well as address key components identified through program review, advisory meetings and student feedback as major gaps in our existing programs and services.","SCE serves a vital role within the North Orange County region in creating an entry point for all adult students, especially those high-risk, underserved populations to gain access to post-secondary education and career technical training was well as a jumping point to moving on to more advanced educational opportunities at both Cypress and Fullerton colleges.

As with Career Technical Education (CTE) credit programs, SCE designs noncredit CTE programs to ensure students are prepared with the necessary technical skills required for the occupation for which they trained. While our noncredit certificate programs include strong technical skills within the curriculum, gaps have been identified in the effective preparation of employability “soft” skills; understanding of the available pathways from education to employment and advancement; an ",\n,\n,\n
"The Medical Assistant program prepares students for an entry-level position as a medical assistant in a front office (administrative) and back office (clinical setting). The program consists of a sequence of courses that prepares students with the knowledge of skills needed to perform the tasks of a medical assistant in keeping the office of physicians, podiatrist, chiropractors, and other health practitioners running smoothly.","During the 2012-2013 and 2013-2014 school year, NOCE received an Industry Driven Regional Collaboration grant to expand the capacity of our medical assistant program and increase student employment. As part of this grant funding, we were able to offer qualifying students vouchers to complete the National Healthcareer Association (NHA) Clinical Medical Assistant Certification exam. Approximately 90% of students completing the program took the certification exam. When that funding ended, SCE continued to promote the certification exam, however, the rate dropped significantly and now there are approximately only 5-10% of students completing our program report taking this industry recognized certification exam.

Although certification is not currently required to work as a medical assistant, the regional medical assisting advisory group has identified it as a key success factor in students gaining employment. Additionally, discussions are occurring throughout the state to mandate certification in the near future for all healthcare workers.

In an effort to increase the number of graduating students who take and pass the certification exam, our full-time faculty member, began a partnership with the Orange County Healthcare Deputy Sector Navigator to offer NHA review classes. SCE ran its first review class in fall 2015, which was attended by approximately 38% of our graduating class (35 of 92 students). It was reported by the faculty and CTE staff that many of the students completing the review course did not have the funds to take the certification exam. Additionally, approximately 30% of the students invited to take the free review course opted out due to the inability to pay the certification exam fees.

To increase access to and successful completion of the NHA certification exam, we propose to: develop a process for students to be eligible to receive vouchers for either the practice exam and review materials, the certification exam or both; develop a self-sustaining way to implement a review course for the NHA exam; and purchase NHA practice exams and certification vouchers.

If funded, this would increase the percentage of students who take and pass industry recognized certification that leads to successful workforce outcomes.

"The purpose of this proposal for CTE Branding/Marketing is to increase CTE enrollments, certificate/degrees, employment rates, and median income for students by improving the online discover-ability of CTE programs, providing targeted advertising, sharing career resources, and improving the overall quality of communication with CTE students. This proposal represents costs for Cypress College plus additional funding for scaling up to district-wide implementation.","According to the California Community College Taskforce on Workforce Job Creation and a Strong Economy, students who complete an AA in General Education earn $38,500 5-years later, whereas students who complete an AA in Career Technical Education earn $66,000, or $27,500 (42%) more per year or one million dollars in a life-time. The benefit of a CTE education may be the best kept secret among high school students and the people who influence them. This project aims to capitalize on the state and regional efforts to change this perception while increasing the number of potential students in existing and emerging CTE programs throughout our district. 

We need to fund this project in order to increase the quantity of CTE students by increasing the CTE course fill-rate by 2-4% per year (which also produces a corresponding increase the number of CTE students enrolled in GE courses). For 2016-2017, the 26 CTE TOP Coded programs at Cypress College had an average fill-rate of 81.3%, which was below the campus the other (non-CTE) course average of 88.5%. The CTE fill-rate at Fullerton was 79.6%.  Therefore, there is an opportunity to increase CTE productivity and program stability without adding faculty or classes.  Next, at Cypress College, CTE degrees account for about 45% of degrees, and CTE certificates account for 98% of all certificates issued. A corresponding 2-4% increase in awards is projected as well.  Finally, our CTE programs currently compete with many proprietary schools that have slick online marketing campaigns and search engine optimization metrics that actively seek out potential students. This project will support CTE programs across the campus and district by improving the quality of CTE communication, outreach, and pathway promotion.

This project will address these needs by implementing the following components:  

1. Discoverability and Search Engine Optimization (SEO-keyword search)  
   a. (Contract Service: Potential Brightedge @ $75,000 per year) 
   b. Measure where we are on searches and move programs to the first page 

2. Digital Marketing (Google Analytics, Geo-fencing, Keywords, Facebook, Instagram) 
   a. Contract vendor @ $75,000 per year) 

3. Website Augmentation for CTE landing pages, program resources (web-development @ $35,000 per year) 
   a. Vendor (TBD or same as Perkins’ website vendor)  

4. Marketing and Digital Outreach  
   a. Video 25 programs @ approximately $4000 each = $50,000/2 years x 2.5 colleges 

5. Professional Expert: Website Analytics and Digital Outreach Special Project Coordinator: $35,000 x 2.5 colleges 
   a. Include “Emma” email and CTE landing page response coordinator 

6. Professional Expert: Counselor to assist with career pathways, dual enrollment, industry credit $35,000 x 2.5 colleges.

Organizationally, Marc Posner, Cypress College Communications Director, and Kathleen Reiland, Faculty and CTE Liaison to the Academic Senate will consult with ALL Cypress College CTE TOP Coded programs and stakeholders to achieve the project objectives. Fullerton College and SCE will also identify coordinators who will manage this project on their campuses as well.  In addition, all constituents will collaborate with NOCCCD, regional community colleges, and state entities working on CTE branding, online optimization, and promotion.

"In the past 30 years, US economy has shifted from a manufacturing-based economy to one more dependent on services, information and technology.  Accordingly, cybersecurity content and career development should be at the forefront of such an effort as the cybersecurity industry is projected to grow to $170 billion by 2020. This challenge can only be effectively addressed if K-12 and higher education align curriculum and resources to increase the quantity and quality of Cybersecurity professionals.","K-12 public education is developed on principles that all students need a solid foundation of core academic knowledge and lifetime skills to be successful. In reality, this has translated into a single goal of preparing students for 4-year colleges rather than providing a multifaceted approach to career development.  As a consequence, high school dropout rates are still a major concern even for relatively affluent districts such as Anaheim Union High School with only 88% graduation rates in 2016 (EdSource.org). Furthermore, high school graduates are not necessarily ready to complete college or transfer to 4-year schools as is evident from the low completion rates.  Only 53.1% of Cypress college first time students received a degree, certificate and/or transferred after six years beginning in 2010-2011. (scorecard.cccco.edu). 

Cypress College has developed a collaborative partnership with NICERC and the Anaheim Union High School District. We have the opportunity to bring foundational knowledge in Cyber with a technical skill set to the K-12 local school districts. Bringing college faculty together with high school faculty is vital to creating a seamless transition of integrating cybersecurity curriculum. AUHSD’s superintendent, Mike Matsuda, supports partnerships through dual enrollment courses and has asked Cypress College to develop a cybersecurity pathway.

A guided Cybersecurity pathway that builds on cyber content developed during Middle school years is most likely to succeed. Introducing dual enrollment pathway as early as 10th grade with multiple educational and employment exit points is applicable to a wider student population and will positively impact high school and college dropout rates.

Developing a cyber defense program endorsed by national organizations ensures program quality and attracts students and resources on a larger scale. The overall goal of this project is to develop and implement a Pathway to Advancement of Cybersecurity Education (PACE) from MS all the way to 4-year College with multiple opportunities for employment exit points. The specific objectives of PACE are to: 1.Develop a plan based on Collaboration with all the stakeholders 2.Embed Cybersecurity content in MS/HS curricula 3.Provide outreach activities to generate interest in Cybersecurity 4.Develop/revise Cybersecurity certificate and AA degree programs 5.Provide articulation and alignment with 4-year institutions 6.Prepare Cypress college to become a CAE2Y institution 7.Evaluate PACE and recommend best practices ",\n,\n,\n
"Hire one FTEF Adjunct CTE counselor for the Cypress College campus.","There are approximately 3,000 students in the Cypress College Career Technical Education division. Numbers have been steadily growing since 2006 to the 2014/2015 high of 3,600. While an overall downturn in numbers is anticipated by our district, the State of California is dedicating funds and attention to CTE programs and students. Even with a possible downturn, current FTES and fill rates remain high. Furthermore, statewide resources for marketing and branding of CTE programs will be in full swing beginning this summer.  The standard ratio of students to counselors is 800 to 1. At Cypress College however, the current ratio is 3,000 students to 1 full time counselor and 600 students to one part time counselor. Even at conservative estimates of 2,000 students (per a possible downturn) this is nearly triple the standard counseling load. This absence of adequate counseling services may become an equity issue: students deserve better, especially when half of all of our students are Hispanic and half of all of our students qualify for financial aid, and per the State of California imposing a requirement for an educational plan for each student upon reaching 15 units.

"The radiology and sonography students require phantoms to simulate real patient imaging prior to hospital training. Practice on these phantoms increases the ability of the students to quickly assimilate into the hospital environment and begin working with real patients safely with competence and confidence. This request includes imaging phantoms for both the radiology and sonography students.","A “phantom” is precisely manufactured mannequin that simulates real human bodies in natural bone and soft tissue structures such as the uterus, ovaries, and fetal anatomy. 

In radiology, imaging humans is not allowed in the lab setting, therefore, the students use the phantoms to practice positioning for radiographic procedures. The students take a radiographic image to determine if they have correctly positioned the phantom. 

In sonography, students are not allowed to image pelvic or obstetric exams due to the intimate nature of the exam and for liability purposes. The Sonography Mentor simulator is a phantom that combines a realistic mannequin with true-to-life external landmarks and realistic virtual patients for the practice of sonography scanning and diagnosing various pathologies of the pelvic organs and fetal anatomy seen on a computer monitor. 

The current full body radiology imaging phantoms are over 25 years old and some of the limbs have detached and oil has leaked out. The current, old phantoms are heavy and difficult to move and position properly. This Strong Workforce funding request is to replace these phantoms with SuperTech phantoms that have a synthetic skeleton, lungs, liver, mediastinum and kidneys embedded in a soft tissue substitute. These phantom are also lighter and will be less risky for student injury when moving the phantoms. These newer imaging phantoms will better prepare our students for real patients, since they are more life-like in movement and anatomy, and increase student confidence and competence for a better chance of employment after graduation, at higher earnings,  along with increasing the quality of the Radiologic Technology Program (successful workforce outcome). 

The sonography students do not have any imaging phantoms to practice pelvic and obstetric exams. Because sonography students’ scanning skills are primarily developed at the hospital site, the students take longer to learn because of the time constraints of the hospital patient schedule.  Students are therefore unable to scan as much. Training in the College lab on the new Simbionix 3D sonography imaging phantoms, especially for pelvic and obstetric exams, will prepare the students to scan live patients with more competence and confidence. This knowledge developed in the lab will allow them to scan more at the hospital (since they will be faster at that point), improve their chance of success and more easily gain employment after graduation, at higher earnings,  along with increasing the quality of the Diagnostic Medical Sonography Program (successful workforce outcome).

"To meet the growing need for student completion in community colleges, the accounting department wants to offer 3 new certificates to get students to employable skills faster with the hope that once employed, students will return to complete a full degree as part of the individual's continuous learning demanded by today's workforce. All courses for these certificates will be offered online and be available to all students in California serving not only our own geographic location.","The accounting faculty at Cabrillo College are continually seeking ways to help students enter the workforce with stronger credentials that meet the employment demands for today’s workforce. We routinely met with industry representatives in focus groups to assess their needs and make appropriate, updated changes in our curriculum. We are motivated by the findings from articles like one from Inside Higher Ed that states “Certificates are the fastest-growing college credential, with a big wage payoff.” (Fain). Additionally, we also recognize that many students would benefit from targeted learning that a certificate provides as summarized by this quote from U.S. News and World Report: “In some professions, a certificate from a community college may hold more weight with hiring managers than a graduate degree.” (Sheehy). Based on the results of our focus meetings and supported by current literature, we are proposing the creation of three new Certificates of Achievement: 1) Certificate of Achievement in Payroll Accounting-1 semester, 12 hours; 2) Certificate of Achievement in Tax Preparation-2 semesters, 16 hours; 3) Certificate of Achievement in CPA Exam Preparation-3 to 4 semesters, 32 hours that provides the necessary hours to meet the 150 hour rule for a CPA license as required by the American Institute of Certified Public Accounting (AICPA). 
To support these certificates, 8 new courses will have to be developed along with updating one existing course. The new courses are: 
1. ACCT 51A - Intermediate Accounting 2. ACCT 51B - Intermediate Accounting 3. ACCT 54B - Income Tax-Corporations 4. ACCT 54C - Income Tax Partnerships, Estates & Trusts 5. ACCT 58 - Auditing 6. ACCT 59 - Fraud Examination 7. ACCT 66 - Managerial Cost Accounting 8. ACCT 72 - Financial Statement Analysis 
ACCT 155 Payroll Tax and Accounting will be revived, updated and rebranded and will include QuickBooks, a leading accounting software product in today’s market. 
These courses will also be included in the approved electives so students following different degrees or certificates will have more choices that will potentially make their chosen path more meaningful. No cannibalization of existing courses is expected.

The main shop and automotive classrooms are located in Cypress College building 10, TE-1, which is a 50-year-old facility and program that has grown to 525 students and 6 full time instructors. In addition to teaching students, the Automotive Technology department runs a full-time Automotive Technology Repair Facility that is registered with the Bureau of Automotive Repair (BAR) of the state of CA.  In addition, to the general automotive training program, a separate two year cohort educational pathway for Toyota/Lexus training and an electric vehicle program that supports Tesla and other electric vehicle manufacturers are offered at Cypress College. At this point in time, the Automotive Technology Department has utilized and run-out of critically needed work space needed as outlined by Toyota and other industry partners. Over the years additional lab and classroom space has been acquired by the Automotive Technology department.  Moreover, scheduling courses has been expanded throughout the day and night with courses starting at 7:00AM and others running up to 10:00PM Monday through Friday (Spring 2017). Therefore, this proposal will address additional work space (fig 1), acquiring specialized emerging technology diagnostic equipment and tools, building of two electric vehicle charging stations, providing professional development opportunities in new and emerging technologies and develop/disseminate a market/outreach campaigned aimed at parents, counselors and future students.

","There is a strong need for the infection control coordinator certification course. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration requires all dental offices to have an infection control trainer and Centers for Disease Control recommends that all dental offices have an infection control coordinator. 

There currently is no program offered to train these coordinators. DH plans on increasing enrollment by developing an Infection Control Coordinator Certificate program. This non-credit course will be developed to meet the needs of the community and students. We are arranging the course on days dental offices are typically closed to increase enrollment. 

The DH program will also continue to promote and deliver the non-credit Dental Front Office certificate program. We have had great success with the first course in Dental Terminology and already have over 28 people on a waiting list for the second course. 

DH students would benefit from having access to: Statim sterilizer, M11 Sterilizer, Sterilizer racks, washer disinfector, an additional computer devoted to the programs and an inter-oral camera. These are all vital parts to delivery of these 2 noncredit certificate program. 

1.) We have 28 students taking two new DH non-credit enhanced courses (DH553A and DH553B).
2.) We anticipate up to 18 enrolled in the infection control certificate program. This certificate will not only allow the student to pursue a job in dentistry but start their own business as a consultant in infection control for the dental industry.

","The proposed project is the development of a Nurse Residency Program (NRP) designed to transition new graduates into the professional nursing role.  Assisting new graduates in retaining their nursing knowledge by providing additional learning and ongoing mentoring and support will improve their marketability for employment and aid them in becoming a more competent professional.  New graduates who have participated in NRPs have reported enhanced job satisfaction and reduced stress while organizations participating in NRPs have realized decrease turnover and positive return on investment.Current projections concerning the decreased supply of experienced nurses underscores the key role that new graduates will play in the employment pipeline for acute care hospitals.  However, a survey conducted by the National State Boards of Nursing reported that only 41.9% of employers felt that new graduate RNs were prepared to give safe and effective care. This gap between new graduate preparedness and performance expectations are a documented stress and may influence graduate nurse retention.  Reported median turnover rates for new graduate employment have ranged from 35% to 61%.  New graduate nurses need work environments which are optimized towards their success so they may be retained.  This includes providing supports to afford better understanding of organizational and bureaucratic structures and assisting in growth from the student role to the competent nurse.
A transitional program for new graduates is essential. This is echoed by The Joint Commission which identified NRPs as a strategy to bridge the gap between new graduate preparedness and their professional readiness and  congruent with the recommendation by the Institute of Medicine to implement NRPs to support transition-to-practice.The desired outcomes of the NRP include:
• increase critical thinking skills
• obtain additional competencies
•  increase decision making and communication skills
•  facilitate safety and prioritization of care
•  reduce turnover
•  improve support 
•  enhance job satisfaction
Hiring and precepting inexperienced nurses tax hospital resources.  This project aims to partner with acute care hospitals to develop and implement a NRP.  Funding will enable cultivation of program components which are:

","This project will support the initial research and framework development of a standardized program to aid perspective or current students in “finding their CTE career”.  Broad questions that will be explored include: How does each SCCRC college counsel students in selecting a career?  What is the best way to assess a student’s strengths and interest that may guide them to a career direction?  What is the best information and/or source(s) that will allow a student to further explore a chosen career?

"We will update our current lab with new computers and monitors, purchase new software, and well as purchase new equipment to be used in the field.  This equipment will include surface laptops, drones, infrared cameras, GPS units, and a dedicated server.","Geographic Information Systems (GIS) is often described as an emerging technology.  It is viewed as having its place only in the realm of Geography.  However, this is a gross misconception.  GIS has been at the forefront of spatial analysis for well over a decade and is receiving praise as vital technology for many disciplines.  Increasingly students are finding that in order to be competitive in job pools for their disciplines they must have working experience using GIS to advance in the interview process.  This shift is largely due to the information age that we live in.  Being able to understand theory and perform data collection are no longer enough.  Students are now required to be able to make sense of “Big Data.”  This means having the ability to take digital information and give it meaning to whatever particular discipline that it may be applied toward.  

The quality of the program is key to student success.  Like many emerging technologies, GIS is evolving rapidly.  Yearly, the Geography/GIS department meets with industry professionals in an advisory committee to discuss, among other things, new advances in GIS technology.  For the past two years the committee has suggested that we offer more courses on aerial imaging with drones and the development of web applications.  In GIS, aerial imaging is often used to assess quality, stress, and overall health of agriculture.  These images are taken with drones equipped with a special lens that can capture spectral information. Finally, a GIS analyst can process the data to draw conclusions from.  Web applications in GIS are also on the rise.  Companies are now engaged in developing application that can be used by employees out in the field to collect, edit, and manage GIS data on the go.  This requires training in basic Visual Studio and well as access to new GIS software such as ArcGIS for server, Drone2Map, ESRI insights, and City Engine to process and build these applications.  To really take on all of these new frontier that GIS is blazing a trail into we will need to invest a significant amount of money into updating our current lab with new computers and monitors, purchase new software, and well as purchase new equipment to be used in the field.  This equipment will include surface laptops, drones, infrared cameras, GPS units, and a dedicated server.
With this investment upgrading and expanding the type of technology accessible to students we will then be able to also expand and increasing the quantity of GIS courses offered at Cypress College.  The new courses would cover Agricultural Imaging, 3D modeling, and Web applications in GIS.  These type of courses are in par with the current evolution of GIS technology and software.
A second advantage in upgrading and expanding the technology and number of course offerings is that it will increase the number of students in our classes. Currently there are no colleges offering classes with these tools.  As we see the number of jobs using aerial imaging and GIS application development increase, we are going to see the number of people seeking training in these areas increase as well.  This will help ensure that Cypress College is ready to meet that demand when the students come looking for these specific classes.
The ultimate goal of the department is to create a GIS program that is “cutting edge.”  Like many CTE programs we face the challenge of keeping up with the latest in technology and techniques.  With the Strong Workforce grant we have a chance to meet both of those goals.  We would soon see the number of courses increase as well as pathways for our students to enter sustainable careers.

"The Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation will enable students and special populations to set goals for themselves and be supported to stay committed to achieving their goals and helping other young people do the same.  Faculty will receive additional resources to infuse entrepreneurship into their existing courses. New laddered certificates will be created to encourage entrepreneurship.","Because entrepreneurship is not centralized or infused into CTE curriculum outside of the business programs, students lack access to resources, planning tools and exposure to entrepreneurial opportunities. There is no support to solve the problems that can be encountered in establishing and managing a new business venture.  Additionally, in the competitive culture today, more students are confused and lack a focus of creating their future. Thus, students take uninterested, minimum wage jobs and are not offered opportunity to be challenged or see a vision of business ownership in their future. Students and special populations who have both a plausible business concept and an interest in starting and running a business need a place to get education, support, and exposure.

The creation of a highly visible Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation will serve as the hub for all entrepreneurship activity on campus. The proposed center will also be a driving force between entrepreneurship activities and the 125+careers and industries offered at Fullerton College.  Expected outcomes include:

•	Create New Certificates in entrepreneurship across all departments and disciplines.
•	Workshops and BootCamps that promote entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial thinking.
•	Materials, Supplies, Services used to support and develop entrepreneurial initiatives such as Videos, Books, Case Studies, Software, Photography, Videotaping, etc. 
•	Class Trips that promote entrepreneurship such as business visits, company tours, speakers, etc. 
•	Class Projects that foster entrepreneurship and introduce or enhance students to entrepreneurial thinking as it relates to their field of study.
•	Provide entrepreneurial education and training to our service region through workshops, conferences, and electronic media.
•	Global Entrepreneurship Conference will be an annual conference to bring entrepreneurs and other speakers on campus for student workshops, competitions and speaking events available to students and the local community.

Entrepreneurial activity is a pillar of economic growth. For evidence of the economic power of entrepreneurship, we need look no further than the United States, where young firms have been shown to be a more important source of net job creation than incumbent firms.

","Academic Internships are a wonderful way for full and part-time students to gain career-related experience while attending college. An internship is an on-site learning experience that is directly linked to a student’s major and/or career interest.

Doing What Matters indentifies photography occupations belonging to the industries of the Technologies/Digital Media sector (emergent). The Fullerton College CTE Professional Photography Program requires students to thoroughly master a myriad of software applications and operate a wide variety of technical equipment.","•	We anticipate that a 100% increase in the quantity of Certificates and Degrees Awarded would be obtained with additional funding for promotion and marketing. Students searching for a vocational career path in photography have little to no means by which to find our program. The photography program does not have any web-presence, is not listed in any outside student periodicals or publications, has never had any press attention, and has limited promotional material. We need to hire a marketing person, on a temporary basis, to promote and establish the presence of the Fullerton College Professional Photography Program. With added promotion we will be able to recruit more students and increase the number of students in our CTE Professional Photography Program.

•	To increase the quality of the CTE Professional Photography Program and to increase the number of students taking our courses, it is imperative that our Photography Program rejuvenates the quality of our technology to stay current with industry standards and provide more technological resources to accommodate a larger student enrollment. Student workplace skills are developed and strengthened through hands on experience and access to specialized industry equipment. We will increase the quality of the CTE Photography Program by providing students access to current specialized technology and equipment.

•	The Photography Department will be able to increase the quantity of course sections offered and develop new courses with the availability of new and additional equipment. In addition we want to pursue both the Associates Degree for Transfer and the Bachelors Degree Track being tested in other community colleges.

•	The Fullerton College Photography Program fills the gap for vocational photography instruction that is not sufficiently attainable in the public educational system. University and State Colleges do not teach the skill sets required for vocational photography careers; instead these institutions concentrate on photography merely as a conceptual art theory and fine-art discipline. Only a few private four-year colleges offer vocational photographic training and these colleges come with a price tag that is mostly unaffordable for the average student. 

•	The Fullerton College Professional Photography Program is poised to become a leading CTE Photography Program that is an affordable alternative to expensive private colleges. A Professional Advisory Committee, with members from many National and Professional Photography Organizations, fully endorses the Fullerton College Photography Program. The Photography Program has faculty with more than thirty years of commercial photography experience, has curriculum that prepares students for employment and mirrors industry occupations, has an established internship program to assist students entering the work force, and has a current presence of international students enrolled in the program presenting opportunities for further international collaborations.

With further support and funding the Fullerton College Photography Department can substantially increase the quantity of Degrees and Certificates awarded, increase the quantity of students enrolled in our program, and increase the quality of our program, which will ultimately provide a greater measure of successful outcomes for  the CTE students choosing a career path in the industry sector of Technologies/Digital Media.

D. To improve biotechnology pathway quality, we propose to:  
 
10. Improve biotechnology education in middle and high schools by providing hands-on skills, lab experience, and training for teachers at beginner and advanced levels. 
 
11. Offer Work Experience for FC students to serve as teaching and laboratory assistants at Fullerton College and regional high school biotechnology courses. This objective will  a. allow Fullerton College students to gain work experience in the field b. assist high school teachers to prepare the complex laboratory reagents necessary to successfully implement the extensive biotechnology curriculum c. link high school students from underrepresented, disadvantaged, or socioeconomically challenged backgrounds to current successful college students from similar backgrounds in order to establish a peer-mentoring relationship d. link high school students who would be first-generation college attendees to current successful college students in order to establish a peer-mentoring relationship.  
 
12. Expand the equipment loan program for regional high schools and improve the associated instructional supplies.  
 
13. Improve and update the biotechnology laboratory manuals.  
 
E. To better track alumni success in transfer and employment, we propose to: 
 
14. Implement a software based tracking program including past and current courses completed, university and graduate education, internship and employment history, and wage advancement. In addition we will attempt to contact students 1, 2 and 5 years following certificate completion to determine if they entered employment in Biotechnology and we will quantify the number of students that transfer to 4 year institutions preparing for higher level positions in the Biotechnology field.

"An updated greenhouse will increase the quality our of CTE program by providing new job skills to students in emerging fields of horticulture called Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA), or indoor agriculture. These new skills acquired by the students will offer either immediate access to jobs or provide them opportunities to further their studies in CEA at universities that have advanced degrees in the subject such as Cal Poly, Pomona or the University of Arizona at Tucson. ","•	Having the tools, an updated, state-of-the art greenhouse, to offer students will benefit the program by giving students an opportunity to explore a career pathway they did even know that existed. This will lead to more certificates and degrees for our Horticulture Program.

•	An increase in students will be demonstrated by the increased numbers of FTEUs as more students will be enrolled in courses that use the greenhouse as a teaching tool. There are no modern greenhouses at any community college within a 100 mile radius of the Fullerton campus that demonstrate what is reflected in the commercial greenhouse world. If students are going to be prepared for the new green job world they need to have classrooms that reflect what is happening in real time. Our 35-year-old greenhouse is not just aged, it is obsolete with siding that does not allow proper light levels into the structure. With water being a valuable resource here in California, it is imperative that we engage our students with horticulture opportunities that will provide them jobs to exist in our modern world. Having a greenhouse that reflects the current state of the industry will prepare our students for new emerging green jobs and careers such as indoor greenhouse managers, technical experts of vertical grow operations managers, technical experts in urban farming operations, technical experts in controlled environment agriculture, technical experts in LED lighting, technical experts in Integrated Pest Management, indoor agriculture, and controlled nutrient delivery systems. 

•	Having highly trained students in Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA) will make our program highly sought after by job recruiters. As a result of our new course in Hydroponics/Aquaponics Hort 250 we have placed several students in the CEA job market. The upgrades that I am proposing will allow the space to be used as a laboratory facility for horticulture, biology, chemistry, physics, and engineering-making this a truly cross campus STEM project. Breathing new life into our old, outdated existing structure will provide additional opportunities for the new CEA job market that is rapidly expanding. Ornamental Horticulture as an industry across the United States is consolidating into large operations leaving fewer top job opportunities for graduating students. As the Ornamental industry contracts massive options are emerging for CEA jobs for growing crops indoors in CEA. Indoor Ag and CEA are the new green wave, and as such having the tools to train students to meet these emerging jobs is critical to sustain our program.

"The goal of this project is to improve the IET collaboration element within the Quick Service Inspection Technician Program, and make it sustainable.","The Quick Service Inspection Technician Program utilizes Integrated Education and Training (IET) to prepare students to succeed in the Auto Tech program. IET is basic skills training in the context of vocational courses. Students entering career education with lower basic and English skills have lower persistence rates. Students often side step ESL/ABE courses in a race to get a job, making the student unsuccessful in vocational programs. The Quick Service Inspection Technician Program offered at ECC uses the IET model to address this issue.
This project aims to address several issues that have been raised:
(1) The current model is not sustainable because it is tied to a specific instructor and the instructor will be leaving the program. To address this issue this project will modify curriculum so that it can be used by other instructors and provide a model for instructor training.
(2) Part of the strength of the program arises from the co-teaching model, where the VESL and Auto Instructor have an overlapping schedule. This allows the VESL instructor to gain the subject matter knowledge necessary to allow her to assist the students with the subject matter content, beyond the language and basic skills. This will be addressed by developing VESL instructor training materials specific to the Automotive courses and funding an overlapping hour for a new instructor for one 13-week cycle.
(3) We propose to track student outcomes to determine their success in completing the Auto Tech program, and use this to inform curriculum and course design revisions, as well as identifying available support services and industry partnerships that will improve student persistence.

The current model using text books and paper-based assignments is inadequate and in some cases is an obstacle for many students. We propose to use this opportunity to examine both the current curriculum and research best practices, and use this to revise the program and curriculum.",\n,\n,\n

","According to a recent survey, an increasing number of employers in both the public and private sectors are adding jobs for statisticians and data analysts but are having a difficult time finding qualified candidates.   Fortune 500 identifies statistics as the fastest-growing STEM major in the US and LinkedIn recently listed data analysis as the most in-demand skill in a recent survey.  Currently there are not enough people with this background to fill the job demand.  The McKinsey Global Institute predicts a shortage of up to 190,000 people with the data analysis skills to work with “Big Data” and in a recent survey of employers conducted by the Society for Human Resource Management, 78% of survey respondents reported having difficulty recruiting qualified candidates for data analyst positions.  Statistics is one of the fastest growing degree programs at 4-year universities, and an increasing number of universities are adding majors or minors in data science as well.  Very few community colleges, however, have clear pathways into the statistics and data science majors.  Since community college serve close to ½ of all undergraduates in the US, including a majority of African-American and Hispanic students, it is vital that community colleges provide access to this growing career field to our students.

"Center for a Competitive Workforce (CCW) was founded as a Strong Workforce Program within the 10 Los Angeles County community college Districts in the L.A. | O.C. Region. CCW links education, and workforce partners to establish high-performing regional talent development systems for the rapidly changing industries that will dominate our economic future in LA.  The Center’s work addresses the talent gaps employers face and the supply of skilled graduates to meet projected workforce demand.
","The Los Angeles/ Orange County regional economy, an almost one trillion dollar tapestry of industrial diversity, riches and opportunity amid wrenching poverty, is being inexorably pulled into the information age, presenting more of its residents with both the promise of economic success and the peril of being further left behind.
The economic future we see today is quite different than the future we envisioned only a few decades ago. In particular, we are in the midst of a structural transition where information technologies, artificial intelligence, machine learning, virtual reality, and ever more powerful computers are changing the nature of work, the need for labor, the organization of firms, and the rewards that work now earns. Without direct and targeted intervention on our parts, as education, economic development and career technical education (CTE) purveyors, there will be neither enough middle skill, middle class jobs nor enough skilled human capital to sustain our regional economy.
The region’s future economic success depends upon a stronger, better informed and more durable collaboration between regional workforce and education institutions and systems, industry firms and economic developers, who will each face an entirely new set and scale of challenges which will demand a synergistic approach. Together we must confront the following challenges:
? What are the economic, technological and globalization forces that are shaping the future industrial makeup and associated labor markets of the region? What are the implications of these future trends to middle skill job opportunities and allied training in the region?
? How does the region ensure that more of its residents have the ability and accessibility to participate in the particular region’s future success and prosperity? What programs are needed to ease the transition for those who are at risk of being left behind?
? How does the region better prepare its local supply of labor for the innovation-intensive industries of tomorrow and more successfully connect this surplus supply of labor transitioning out of the region’s production-based economy?
Leveraging the aspirations and the resources of the Strong Workforce Program, we can forge a powerful new regional partnership to confront these challenges. Hence the vision behind our new Center for a Competitive Workforce.",\n,\n,\n

"The Energy Efficiency / Sustainability project is a response to the Energy Efficiency industry facing serious shortfalls in developing a skilled, trained, and available labor pool. According to a 2016 AEE-Advanced Energy Economy workforce study, statewide an estimated additional 15,000 skilled workers are needed each year to work in the Energy Efficiency industry.
","The September 2016 LAEDC report on the Energy/Construction sector noted “In order to meet the building needs of a growing region, the construction industry requires a continuous supply of workers... The educational and training programs that exist in Southern California are extremely valuable because they provide paths to careers in construction for all skill levels. Universities and community colleges, as well as trade and technical schools, have developed targeted programs aimed at reducing the time spent by new entrants in on-the-job training to create an occupation-ready workforce.”
Los Angeles region colleges have a significant portfolio of programs related to the energy market transformation, and a number of mechanical and electrical career pathways, many of which need to be upgraded to address emerging competencies in energy efficiency. This region offers an ideal platform to develop strategies, best practices, and evidence that can be replicated and scaled.
The Sustainability Pathways project is informed by and has evolved through inputs from industry, policy makers, economic development agencies, faculty and Deans across the region. Colleges that are participating in this initiative offer programs in Process Control, HVACR, Environmental Technologies, Water/Wastewater, Building Automation, Architecture Engineering and Technical drafting technologies, Electronics and Systems Automation, Construction Crafts, Inspection, Welding Technologies, Construction Management and Data Analytics.
Economic, public policy and labor market research are the primary drivers for this project:
? Annual demand for the target occupations in Los Angeles County is 5000+ versus~2,000 completers
? New competencies are needed in all target occupations to accommodate industry trends in Energy Efficiency statutory goals and new/retrofitted building code compliance
? Technology is changing the way projects are managed, how materials are produced and the building process itself. The introduction of new technologies has helped to streamline, automate and speed up building design and construction
? Policies and incentives arising from California’s clean energy and pollution reduction mandates continue to accelerate industry’s evolution to automated solutions
? Clean Energy and Pollution Reduction Act of 2015. the Governor has called for a new set of objectives in clean energy, clean air, and pollution reduction for 2030 and beyond. 1) To increase from 33 percent to 50 percent, the procurement of our electricity from renewable sources. (2) To double the energy efficiency savings in electricity and natural gas of retail customers through energy efficiency and conservation.
? Existing Buildings Energy Efficiency Action Plan (EBEE Action Plan) in September 2015. The plan provides a 10-year roadmap to activate market forces and transform California’s existing residential, commercial, and public building stock into high-performing and energy- efficientbuildings.
? Policies and incentives for adoption of energy efficient systems are at the core of California’s strategy for economic growth and competitiveness in the global market
Legislation such as Proposition 39 and Title 24 (CA Building Code) continues to create new jobs by infusing hundreds of millions of dollars annually in energy efficient buildings and by incentivizing new private investments. New technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Direct Digital Control, Smart Sensors, Analytics, evolving HVACR and environment and control systems, Automated Building Controls, and Artificial Intelligence dominate the way buildings and processes must respond to these drivers. In addition to the supply/demand and new worker competency gaps, multiple studies show a massive need to upskill the incumbent workforce.
The foundation of the EC&U sustainability project is the “Expert Network” of willing and engaged cross-sector Faculty Champions that fosters a channel for industry driven competencies, common outcomes, stackable credentials and credit transportability across regional colleges. The expert network develops as a learning community which thru collaboration and innovation transform the regional programs. Advancing student success by aligning content and outcomes with third party evidence based benchmarks and assessments leading to industry valued credentials. Exploring and implementing work experience and internship programs. Recognizing existing demands on faculty, this project assists in curriculum alignment and development by funding consultants to work at the direction of faculty. It also provides funding for adjunct instructors and guest lecturers to deliver specialized content modules that are infused into existing courses and programs. Professional development opportunities and access to available online and virtual training and assessment program augmentation tools.
The Sustainability Pathways has a primary focus of engaging and expanding an existing Industry Advisory comprised of the Association Energy Engineers, Siemens, Johnson Controls, Honeywell, ABM, Association of Air Conditioning Contractors (ACCA) ASHRAE, International Facilities Management Association, So California Edison, UA250, Operating Engineers local 501, and others with a strong presence in the county. Significant contributions to this advisory are being made by UC Davis, the Southern California HVACR Collaborative, and the National Science Foundation BEST Center.
This initiative includes:
? Alignment of student learning outcomes across the region’s programs
? Transfer of certificate or degree-level credits across participating colleges
? Convening and sustaining an Expert Network that engages industry in faculty planning
? Professional development for faculty, aligned with industry priorities
? A community of practice for sharing curricula and building evidence for replication and scaling
? Engagement of consultants to support faculty in curriculum alignment and development
? Investment in equipment
? Assessment of outcomes and continuous improvement of processes
? Opportunities for braided funding enhancement thru Prop 39, Projects in Common and SWP Local share investments and leveraging multiple funding streams California is recognized for being a leader in energy efficiency and sustainability and has proven its leadership position through its legislative actions and proactive initiatives. Meeting the energy efficiency needs of California will require a skilled workforce to meet the challenges with implementing operational best practices. California’s community colleges play an important and key role in delivering a knowledgeable and skilled workforce.
The objective of the EC&U Sustainability Project is for Bigger AND Better Energy Construction and Utility sector programs with investment in activities, content and outcomes which will create pathways and remove structural barriers to; increase enrollment, improve the number and quality of program completers, provide the technical and employability skills for entry level employment, incumbent workers and career transitions, career advancement and earning potential, life-long learning and advanced education opportunities.
1) Convenings, networking events –
a. Regional Advisories - The community colleges cannot provide this required training alone. Community colleges will need industry to participate and provide support both in leadership and participation in defining, developing and implementing the necessary curriculum content and outcomes.

"This project is a mentoring pilot program for Business and Accounting students, providing mentors who have developed successful careers in industry to BUS/ACCT students, with a focus on students from under-served populations.","CE advisory boards have voiced the need for students to be professionally prepared in their fields of study. This challenge can be daunting in an educational environment where many students come from traditionally underserved backgrounds and have not had the opportunity to develop networks that enable them to obtain career advice from a trusted advisor. Often, they enter the workplace, degree/certificate in-hand with no idea how to get beyond the entry level. Formalized mentoring at MiraCosta will provide students access to individuals who can provide them with the guidance and advice needed to advance into a professional role where they can be competitive for jobs, pursue advanced degree programs, and obtain funding for business ventures. 

This project will support the “more and better” CTE in a variety of ways.  Faculty involvement will include the identification, recruitment, and training of mentors and proteges. Through these recruitment efforts, we will strengthen and deepen relationships with industry partners, create opportunities for internships, fill advisory positions, and we will tap into local employers as a source for new enrollments as they become familiar with CE programs and the value of MiraCosta College as a resource for employee development.  Students who participate in the program will develop critical professional skills we don’t have time to teach in the class-room; they will learn to “navigate” the workplace (and their careers); and gain access to professionals who have developed successful careers in their field of study. The program will be managed on a daily basis by a project coordinator (likely a classified employee) whose role will primarily be limited to program management, event coordination, and ensuring mentors and proteges connect on a regular basis.

Its JAIN program will house information regarding the identified industry partners and their choice of participation in a range of work-based learning activities, from guest speaking and serving on advisory committees, to serving as a mentor or internship supervisor, to posting living wage employment opportunities.  Career Center staff will assist faculty with identifying targeted relevant businesses within their industry and with updating outdated industry contacts.  They will modify JAIN to include the expanded range of participation by employers and opportunities for students, particularly the matching of students and employers for a particular service.  Career Center staff will also develop with PIO the broader employer outreach collateral material for partnering with MiraCosta CE programs and assist the faculty with JAIN.

"The goal of this project is to revise and enhance the existing Tax Program here at MiraCosta College such that it increases the attainment of certificates by students, has both the materials and faculty expertise necessary to provide up to date and relevant curriculum in the tax courses, and provides a clearly defined path for both employment and opportunities for additional professional credentials within the tax field. ","The Tax Program at MiraCosta has several important elements that with revision and enhancement can make an increased contribution to student workforce development. Students by taking one class, ACCT 145-Individual Taxation that is certified by the California Tax Education Council, can become a Registered Tax Preparer in the state of California which allows them to prepare taxes for a fee. In addition, with some revisions and refinement to both the tax curriculum itself and its promotion, the program would have a structure that will assist students in preparing for the IRS Enrolled Agent Exam, which is a highly regarded national certification that confers the same rights and privileges in the practice of the taxation that is granted to both CPAs and Attorneys.  

Elements to be included in this process will include a scaffolding model for certificates, training opportunities and updated materials for faculty, and increased marketing of tax internships and employment positions to students, including the creation of workshops and videos providing information on the IRS Enrolled Agent exam and other tax certifications.  A significant element of the program outreach will to be facilitate the move of non-credit students to the credit pathway that the tax program curriculum represents.

In addition, there will be research done regarding the feasibility of submitting the revised courses to both the IRS and other credentialing agencies, such as the State Board of Accountancy and the National Association of Enrolled Agents, to gain approval for these courses to qualify as continuing education opportunities required for a variety of professional tax certifications.",\n,\n,\n

"This project proposes to expand current Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA) enrollment through the development of faculty approved, by external accreditation board, to teach at the CNA level. This will provide a pipeline of qualified applicants for the subsequent laddered programs, namely, Licensed Vocational Nursing (LVN) and Register Nursing (RN). This project will be positioned to offer a seamless transition from CNA to LVN to RN, thus providing gainful employment and offering future roadmap.  ","Employment of registered nurses, licensed vocational nurses and nursing assistants is projected to grow 17 -20 percent through 2024, much faster than the average for all occupations. Because of the growing elderly population and changes in healthcare delivery models, more nurses and nursing assistants will be needed to assist and care for these patients.  The Health Sciences Division is hiring a full time instructor for the CNA program, however, we would like to train more of our existing faculty to teach in the program, thus expanding capacity.  As such, we will be positioned to offer seamless transition from CNA to LVN to RN.   A significant obstacle is the lack of administrative support for the application and student tracking processes.  We receive approximately 800+ applications each semester for admission to the programs with a total capacity of 80 students across all three programs. Division staff and the Dean process these, calculate GPAs, track required documents, background checks, health clearances and clinical requirements.  This proposal requests funding for faculty professional development and for clerical support to process and track applications and records.

","We are working towards offering Professional Certifications through AVID for Pro Tools software. Turning PCC into an AVID certified institution will undoubtedly increase enrollment in these programs and will give our students recognizable industry-standard certifications. Maintaining up-to-date recording facilities and equipment and training faculty to become Certified Avid trainers is our primary goal with this request.
One serious problem we aim to solve is that the main recording studio in the Center for the Arts building has remained unfinished since its initial build.  Despite the fact that we have state-of-the-art recording equipment, our students in Pro Tools classes currently cannot hear their recordings in the studio properly because of the lack of seating and insulation of the existing main monitors and the lack of a near field monitor system.  This very specialized work will require the hiring of a recording studio acoustics consultant and some labor and materials. Additionally, our much-used mobile recording rack system is currently being run on hardware that is near obsolete, and does not function properly, so we are requesting updated interfaces so that our certificate students can continue recording large and small ensemble performances in various locations on campus.  We are also requesting much needed data storage for the Pro Tools stations for storing recording sessions and associated Digital Audio Workstation plug-ins.

In response, postsecondary institutions are beginning to take an expanded view of degree-seekers, focusing on attracting post-traditional students (25 and over).  Serving post-traditional adult learners, however, presents the challenge of modifying existing institutional processes designed for traditional students.   The QuickPath PLA Program (PLA) provides a solution by leveraging one of the best kept secrets in postsecondary education, prior learning assessment.  With program partners AcademyOne and the Council for Adult and Experiential Learning (CAEL), and faculty at the pilot colleges West Hills Community College Coalinga and Lemoore, and San Joaquin Delta College leading the initiative, the QuickPath Program is designed to simplify the navigation of prior learning assessment options and expand the offerings to include credit by portfolio assessment. In revealing all the ways students are able to earn credit for their prior learning in an easy-to-navigate platform, colleges will be able to highlight the systems which help students decrease the cost of attendance and time to degree.  With faculty driving the development of portfolio assessment at the pilot colleges, institutions will be able to grow enrollment of post-traditional students who have industry skills and competencies that align with certificate and degree programs, but who do not possess formal credentials or degrees.  Portfolio assessment offers adult learners a way to demonstrate the prior learning they gained from years of industry experience and earn credit for what they already know.  

The QuickPath PLA Program is a faculty led and designed program that allows colleges to offer course credit to students who can demonstrate prior learning. PLA expands the traditional offerings beyond Challenge Exams and CLEP tests to include credit by portfolio assessment. Data shows that the use of Prior Learning Assessment can help increase demand and completions and decrease the cost and time to degree.  West Hills and San Joaquin Delta College received a $2 million Award for Innovation to spearhead the development of the QuickPath Program in the Central Region. The money is being used to pay for a full time coordinator for the program (Dr. Justin Garcia),  AcademyOne’s work to design a multi-institutional regional web platform to facilitate and simplify the navigation of prior learning assessment options for students, the fee for hosting each of the region’s colleges on the QuickPath online platform during Year 1 (ends April 2018), stipends for faculty to develop the policies, procedures, guidelines, regional marketing for all of the colleges, and assessments for the web platform, and consulting fees for The Council for Adult and Experiential Learning (CAEL) who is providing consulting services to faculty as they develop the Portfolio Assessment processes and practices .

Steps include (a) prioritization of target CE programs and audiences; (b) application of media formats; (c) development of a common branding and outreach campaign; and (e) an evaluation plan to measure marketing effectiveness.  ","CTE's share of statewide community college enrollment (FTES) declined from 31.3% in 2000/2001 to 28.2% in 2013/2014.  While non-CTE FTES increased 16.2% during this time period, CE FTES remained about the same.  Overall, in years when total FTES increases, the percentage increase for CE tends to be lower than for non-CTE.  In years when total FTES decreased, the percentage decrease in CE tends to be greater than for non-CTE.   This pattern has been observed in the San Diego/Imperial region as well as statewide. 

CTE enrollments have been in decline throughout the region over the past decade.  However, the gap between job openings and the availability of qualified applicants is expected to increase to over one million jobs statewide by 2025.  The number of students enrolling in CE programs in the region and statewide is not expected to fill that gap.  Strong Workforce Program local funds will provide additional CE training opportunities, but students must learn that they are available and that they offer the ability to earn a living wage.

In addition, regional partners identified several cross-sector employer needs/priorities by utilizing the findings from multiple sector studies.  The top priority is for workers with strong soft skills – communication, professionalism, critical thinking, problem solving, etc.  These soft skills make the difference in securing and retaining employment; previous work experience also is key for many well-paying middle-skill occupations, and employers across sectors report the need for more experienced workforce. Regional employers have difficulties finding qualified employees and are interested in new ways to find and cultivate new talent.  They indicate that industry-based certifications are an indicator to employers of a job candidate’s technical proficiency.  While some businesses surveyed (particularly in advanced manufacturing) indicated a strong interest in partnering with the community colleges for internships and company tours, many were not aware of the training programs that the community colleges offer or how they could partner with the colleges to find a qualified work force.

The colleges in the San Diego/Imperial region seek to increase enrollments in their CE programs.  However, each college has conducted its own marketing of its career technical education programs to students (with publication in the class schedule often the only CE marketing effort).  There is no cohesive, coherent message to all students and potential students in the region.  The State Chancellor's office has retained the services of renowned public relations firm Ogilvie to do an environmental scan and set a path forward on to deploy up to $3 million of state funds.  This project aims to ensure that the San Diego/Imperial regional plan is coordinated with that plan.

In addition, the public workforce system engages employers by program, with different people from different organizations calling employers to hire their participants.  Each college does its own marketing of its career technical education programs to employers; there is no cohesive, coherent message to all employers in the region.  

This project is addressing the identified needs by hiring a marketing firm to develop a regional marketing plan focused on increasing both student and employer involvement in the community colleges, and then implementing that regional plan.

In 2017 SCICCCA hired the marketing firm Civilian to develop a three-year marketing plan for Regional Career Education.  In 2017 Civilian conducted a program analysis, competitive analysis and consumer segmentation. Civilian used this information to develop a three-year marketing plan for Career Education, including brand planning, integrated media, and an evaluation plan.
The regional goal of the three-year marketing plan is to fill middle-skills job gaps. Regional Consortium objectives include (1) increase career education course enrollment, with focus on in-demand sectors; (2) expand the career education market through awareness and consideration among working adults and special populations; and (3) place graduates into the workforce, increasing the graduate employment rate and salary outcomes.  Target audiences include high school students, working adults, parents of high school students, educators of high school students, current community college students, and employers/the business community.  

The three-year plan’s media strategy is to reach audiences at various stages of the enrollment process using a data-driven, segmented approach.  Civilian recommended tactics that serve the purpose of funneling users from being aware to considering, and then enrolling.  Brand tactics include awareness via out-of-home advertising, including billboards and bus wraps to reach the broadest audience; awareness via digital radio with high-frequency, targeted ads; and digital display, which is a mix of media channels that reaches each audience where they are most likely to be online.

Enrollment tactics include the use of high-impact social media, with promoted posts on Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Snapchat; direct response reaching those actively looking for information on continuing their education; and retargeting by analyzing the use of the website and online behaviors to identify drop-offs and then guide them to enrollment.  
Civilian recommended that SDIC develop regional collateral by developing a fact sheet, press kit, PowerPoint presentation, infographics, an information kit for high school guidance counselors, presentation materials for high school assemblies, and talking points and boilerplate that CE Stakeholders can use to provide a consistent message.  The recommended public relations action plan includes a marketing inventory and audit of existing print and digital material as well as current channels used; collaboration with the regional colleges’ Public Information Officers on program milestones and media relations opportunities; collaboration with the WDC in support and collateral needed for employer outreach; development of an editorial calendar to organize content; and identification of student and graduate stories to highlight each college.

The SDIC region will implement these recommendations during 2018 and 2019.  In addition, the project will add regional staff to help coordinate marketing committee meetings and collaborative activities.

The Centers of Excellence deliver regional workforce research and technical expertise to California Community Colleges for program decision making and resource development.  This research and technical expertise include: 

•	Gap Analysis Reports match current and projected employment needs to the regional training supply, identify workforce gaps or oversupply and offer recommendations for alignment.

•	Environmental Scans provide a comprehensive overview for assessing industry trends, occupational needs and training supply, and usually include primary data collection.

•	Key Findings review and highlight significant findings from employer surveys or environmental scans. Short and to-the-point, Key Finding documents are designed for quick reference.

•	Labor Market Assessments provide an overview of the local labor market or college service area for high level planning and strategic development.

•	Research Briefs are customized for COE clients and vary in length and content.

•	Consultation and Technical Expertise is available to assist in the interpretation and application of data and research findings. The COE also provides input to organizations about data applications and tools that give community colleges better access to labor market information.

COE funds only one position for the San Diego/Imperial region, making it difficult for colleges to access the information they need in a timely manner.  This project will provide additional funding to the San Diego Imperial Region COE to enable it to employ more staff and expand the services provided.

"We propose to increase the number of students who complete certificates in Business Information Technology—especially for the two Business Information Worker certificates that we have implemented and cleared through C&I and that are recognized by the Chancellor's Office—by using customer relationship management (CRM) techniques employed in business to increase sales.","Students do not recognize that they are eligible to complete a certificate because college tracking for certificates is limited to Degree Works, which is not fully implemented, is not targeted to certificate completers, and completely misses students who could complete a certificate along the way to another goal.
Additionally, Degree Works is dependent upon the student tracking his or her own progress and declaring a major with little or no guidance—a major that might be an unreasonable goal for the student. Degree Works does not have the capability to recognize or encourage stackable credentials.
For example, many students take several BIT courses either because they are required for another certificate or degree—Accounting or AST-Business—or because they wish to gain computer skills. After taking one or two courses in BIT, students frequently take additional courses because they recognize the value of strong computing skills for any job, they like the faculty in the program, and they like the many online courses they can take, which fit into the schedules of working adults.
The result is that students end up with 3-6 completed BIT courses, which—with the addition of one or two more courses—could culminate in a BIT certificate.
Data received from the PCC Office of Institutional Effectiveness in November of this year indicates that in the past three years, over 500 students have successfully completed (earned a grade of C or better) multiple courses in Business Information Technology, and yet we have no way to target and encourage these students to complete a certificate.

According to Center for Excellence the nurse assistant occupation is projected to have 263 job opening annually and is listed number 1 and 2 on the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics. Many Long-term Care facilities need a higher proportion of health care givers to provide the daily care for the older patient residing in their facilities. The Nurse Assistant Program trains students to become qualified and competent in skills i.e. transferring and ambulating patients using a gait belt and performing vital signs. To increase student’s living wage after completing the CNA program, additional curriculum could be develop to offer additional training in Restorative Care Aide, Senior Nurse Assistant, Acute Care Nurse Assistant, Dementia Care and Communicating with Compassion. Currently within the Stanislaus County and surrounding areas the above courses are not offered at the community college level, and students are required to travel outside of the community for training. The program plans to seek CTE funding to develop and teach these important courses to increase student’s skill set to increase their living wage.  

The advisory committee, Columbia and attendees at the Columbia College Health Care Career Summit are in full support of expanding the Nurse Assistant program at Modesto Junior College to include a cohort of 30 students at Columbia College to positively impact students’ education. The committee is excited about the possibility of the college offering additional courses that address the needs of the older population, the care facilities in the community and provide increased living wages for CNA student graduates.

"The focus of the Regional Project is to provide continued support to the Central Valley Simulation Group (CVSG), a simulation users network group established in year one of SWP. ","The CVSG is a collaborative group that is very active and would continue the work on further developing and refining our shared resources and evidenced based practices. A primary goal this second year is for the group to join and become active in California Simulation Alliance’s Central Valley subdivision. This will provide additional collaboration to strengthen our group’s knowledge and access further resources.  The Health Simulation Proposal addresses several needs of the Central Valley and our regional partners. It has been well documented the need of qualified healthcare workers in this highly underserved area. In fact, Registered Nurses (RN), Licensed Vocational Nurses (LVN), Emergency Medical Technicians (EMT), and Paramedics have been consistently identified in the top 100 occupations based on projected needs, with RN’s identified with the highest annual openings. In addition, the health and long term care needs of our aging population, including increased medical emergencies; growing numbers of people accessing the healthcare system due to the recent reforms in healthcare; the anticipated acceleration of retirements of healthcare workers, and the subsequent job vacancy forecast, all lead to a dismal projection in providing qualified trained healthcare professionals. (https://www.labormarketinfo.edd.ca.gov (2017). Despite an overall increase in enrollment numbers in the RN, LVN, EMT, and Paramedic Programs over the last 4 years, local hospitals report growing vacancy rates up to 12 – 18% with an upsurge in turnover rates. In addition, long term agencies, correctional institutions and outpatient facilities are reporting even higher vacancy and turnover rates. The increased enrollment numbers has created clinical placement site issues. Clinical sites are severely impacted creating limited space. This proposal, and its subsequent benefits, will decrease the impacted space at each clinical site, allowing students to participate in simulation based training in lieu of physically being present at the clinical sites, and will promote standardized clinical educational experiences of the Allied Health Division (faculty and students). In our central region we have a severe deficit of nurses, particularly in the specialty areas (Emergency Department, Critical Care Units, Perioperative Care, Ambulatory Care, and Labor and Delivery). This proposal will aid in both training faculty in Simulation education, integrate into curriculum, and provide consistent simulated educational experiences for the students. This will be necessary for the outlying areas where there are limited opportunities to care for higher acuity patients. In 2002, The Joint Commission (TJC) established National Patient Safety Goals as a method to reduce errors in healthcare settings. Examples of patient safety measures include use of EHR and bar code scanning of medications. Some clinical sites are reluctant to give access to the EHR and automated medication dispensing units, and therefore students may have limited opportunities to use these safety tools. Simulation provides practice of these skills in a safe, controlled environment allowing learning experiences which will promote a smooth transition into the workforce.",\n,\n,\n

","Industry projections continue to increase for demand of qualified employees with welding and fabrication skills. The American Welding Society has actually raised the anticipated number of people needed to meet industry shortages to 300,000 by the year 2020. On a local level, we are seeing trade union training programs implement pre-apprenticeship courses to seek out and better prepare those entering an indentured apprenticeship as well as regional companies inquiring as to our ability and willingness to train employees to their standards for direct hire. All possible segments of industry – food processing, structural/construction, transportation - just to name a few - seem to be equally in need of qualified individuals. Because the various segments have specific needs relative to joining processes, alloys, and service requirements, the program has to be broad based in its curriculum and resources to be effective.  Fortunately, the program has moved into a new facility that offers improvements in both work space and classroom upgrades. This allows us to make improvements in equipment and resources that previously could not be considered. This translates into exposing more students to better work environments comparable to what would be encountered in industry.

"Strong Workforce Funding will be used to remodel the Dental Lab in Glacier Hall, on the West Campus of Modesto Junior College (MJC) into a large lab space for use by the programs in Allied Health.","Since 2016, the medical assisting program increased the number of students in their program by 37%. Presently, there is not enough classroom space in Glacier Hall to accommodate the medical assisting students.  Two classrooms in the old John Muir Hall building are being used even though the classroom design makes instruction difficult for faculty and students.   Medical assisting students from fall and spring cohorts share classroom space in Glacier Hall.  The medical assisting skills lab only accommodates  16 students at full capacity.  This space limitation requires half of the students from one course to overflow into the classroom and sit at the back while another medical assisting course is simultaneously conducted. This does not support instruction or learning and is not consistent with the college's mission statement of providing a dynamic, innovative educational environment.

The proposed project will address the needs of our growing Allied Health programs by remodeling the existing dental lab that has been unused for six and a half years.

"Through this project, the Fashion Department will develop and offer shop experience to students through courses that provide real world experience, while teaching fundamental as well as advanced alteration, embroidery, surface design, and decorative apparel techniques. As part of their lab class, students will run an alterations, embroidery, surface design and decorative apparel shop, including marketing their services, taking orders from the public, and performing alterations.","According to the Department of Labor, California has the highest rate of employment for tailors, dressmakers and custom sewers as of May 2016. In California, the median income for tailors, dressmakers and custom sewers is between $33K and $45K and offers the highest rate in pay in the country. There are 90 people employed in the Sacramento/Roseville/Arden Arcade area. There are over 24 alterations, dress making and tailoring businesses listed in the Sacramento area based on Google search. There are over 50 businesses that specialize in decorative finishes such as screen printing, heat setting, and embroidery. The employment opportunities for students of ARC are immense.  

Employers are looking for skilled workers who are familiar with and can work with their machinery or similar machinery. This will allow businesses to either maintain or improve productivity levels without having to spend an exorbitant amount of time or money training new employees. Having the skill to work with specialized machinery will give our students an advantage when looking for employment beyond designing, developing and sewing clothing. Employers will hire employees who already have a specialized skillset over those who do not. Many potential employers run shops where they alter clothing, embroider motifs and heat seal designs and treatments. Some employers also have digital printers and laser cutters to help expedite the process of designing decorative elements and adhering them to garments and accessories.  

There are many students who have interest in starting their own businesses without the large investment needed for industrial machinery. Students will be able to make a nominal investment and can start working for themselves as tailors, seamstresses, dressmakers and, in alterations and as surface and textile designers.

American River College’s Fashion Program offers many courses that build marketable skills. ARC needs more courses focused on specific skills. ARC does not currently offer stand-alone courses in alterations, heat sealing and embroidery. The Fashion Department does not offer simulated work environments as lab courses. The Fashion Department does not have the time or the space to cover alterations in great detail under the current curriculum or course offerings. In order to offer simulated work environments, the program will need to initially invest in equipment in order for students to learn more and make it a better program. After the initial investment, the equipment will pay for itself and will last past 10 years. 

Alterations is an experience based skill set and students will only gain experience through scenarios that they come in contact with based on how a garment fits a model or client. With the alterations course, students will gain more exposure, knowledge and experience with fitting and properly altering garments. As a result, this will accelerate the learning curve of our students.

With the decorative elements course, students will learn how to design and create their decorative elements using, heat press, laser cutters and embroidery machines. After taking this course, students will be able to combine their newly acquired skills with their major making them more desirable candidates in the job market.

The surface and textile design course will give students the knowledge to create artwork by hand or by computer. They will also gain experience creating repeat and engineered prints and loading files to be digitally printed on a fabric printer. Students will build a portfolio of original artwork that they can start selling after they complete the course. Surface and textile design is a profession that requires little investment. Students only need Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop, and their imagination. 

This project will also address the issue of equity in the program. Many students that have been disproportionately impacted do not finish courses in the Fashion and Merchandising Program. For example, for the 2015-2016 school year, 40% of African American students received a grade of A or B in the any course taken in the Fashion Program. The number rises to 50% when African American students receive an A, B or C in a fashion or merchandising course. Students who take these courses will work in an environment that simulates a workroom in an alterations and/or print/embroidery shop. In the embroidery and heat setting/decorative elements course, students will be able to sign up without pre-requisite requirements. This investment will allow students who have been disproportionately impacted to take courses where upon completion, they can seek employment and will be able to easily transition into a professional workroom due to their knowledge and experience with the machinery and best practices. Students will also be able to start running their own alterations business and sell their original artwork for surface design projects and programs.

The program will partner with local businesses to provide these businesses with a well prepared, engaged and eager workforce for internship and job opportunities. With the specific skillsets that this program can provide, students will build more skills that will prepare them for more opportunities in the workforce.

The College serves 35,000 students and had a recruitment base of 4 feeder districts (San Juan Unified, Natomas Unified, Center Unified, and Twin Rivers Unified).  The two full time outreach specialists do not have the capacity or bandwidth to develop expertise in Career Education Programs or respond to Career Education outreach requests.  A lack of coordination and communication has also been an issue related to Career Education outreach. Currently, when requests for Career Education based outreach come from feeder high schools or community partners, an uncoordinated response is delivered from the College.  Available faculty, temporary staff, and administrators attend functions, events, and activates on behalf of Career Education.  There are numerous times when a College representative is not available. The College currently has one Dual Enrollment program at Highlands High School.  Plans are in place to expand Dual Enrollment to 5 additional High Schools by Fall 2018, requiring additional coordination and support from the College.

"This project is designed for the Affordable Learning Materials Project Director to work with CTE faculty in identified programs to locate appropriate learning materials in both OER (basically no-cost) and low-cost materials.  The Director would then work with the CTE faculty members and other staff, such as instructional designers, to adapt and modify the identified materials to fit the needs of the CTE curriculum at ARC.","High textbook costs continue to deter students at ARC from purchasing assigned materials for classes, despite the fact that lack of such materials is injurious to successful completion of the course.  As noted in several national surveys conducted by the Public Interest Research Group (PIRG) in 2014 and 2016, students are forced to forego assigned textbooks---which are an essential aid in learning new material, completing assignments, and studying for exams---because they are too expensive, and are knowingly accepting the risk of a lower grade to avoid paying for the textbook. With this program, ARC seeks to boost college access and completion, particularly for underserved students, by engaging faculty and others in the replacement of proprietary/commercial textbooks with more affordable learning materials, both no-cost, primarily with the use of open education resources (OER), and low-cost materials.

Students who had foregone purchasing a textbook were concerned that doing so would hurt their grade in a course. More than half of the students felt significant concern for their grade. It is concerning that students are forced to forego assigned textbooks – which are an essential aid in learning new material, completing assignments, and studying for exams – because they are too expensive. This also means that students are not only choosing not to purchase the materials they are assigned by their professor, but they are knowingly accepting the risk of a lower grade to avoid paying for the textbook.

Over the last decade, the price of college textbooks has soared. Since 2006, the cost of a college textbook increased by 73% - over four times the rate of inflation. Today, individual textbooks often cost over $200, sometimes as high as $400.  As a result, ARC students are feeling the pinch: they can either purchase the necessary textbook and add to their financial hardship, take time away from studying to work extra hours, or go without the book and accept the consequences.

Awareness of more affordable learning materials, especially OER,  among U.S. higher education teaching faculty has improved, but still remains less than a majority, according to a new report from the Babson Survey Research Group (Opening the Textbook: Open Educational Resources in U.S. Higher Education, 2015-16).  Survey results, using responses of over 3,000 faculty, show that OER status is not a driving force in the selection of educational materials – with the most cited barrier being the effort required to find and evaluate such materials. While use of OER is low overall, it is somewhat higher among large enrollment introductory-level courses. Faculty awareness of OER has increased, with 25% of faculty reporting that they were “Aware” or “Very Aware” of open educational resources, up from 20% last year.  The most common factor cited by faculty when selecting educational resources was the cost to the students. After cost, the next most common was the comprehensiveness of the resource, followed by how easy it was to locate.

This project is designed for the Affordable Learning Materials Project Director to work with CTE faculty in identified programs to locate appropriate learning materials in both OER (basically no-cost) and low-cost materials.  The Director would then work with the CTE faculty members and other staff, such as instructional designers, to adapt and modify the identified materials to fit the needs of the CTE curriculum at ARC.  Proposed activities include:

•	Conducting workshops to inform ARC CTE faculty about affordable learning materials (e.g. textbooks and manuals) for use in classes with no loss in academic quality or rigor.  Such affordable materials include no-cost materials, especially Open Educational Resources (OER), and low-cost materials (generally acknowledged as $40 or less).

•	Identifying OER materials (no-cost) that would be appropriate for CTE courses.

•	Identifying Low-Cost materials that would be appropriate for CTE courses.

•	Working with CTE faculty and appropriate staff (e.g. instructional designers) to adapt no- and low-cost materials to the needs of courses in ARC CTE programs.

"This project is a continuation of a Year 1 SWP project designed to increase capacity, enrollment, student success, and retention in ARC's Nursing Program.  A full-time Nursing Instructor will allow the college to capture and maximize enrollments. The Nursing Student Success Coordinator will provide guidance, support, remediation and recommendations for student improvement in the nursing program in both theory and clinical performance. The Nursing IA will provide added support to Nursing students","The overall attrition rate of the nursing program is 10 – 15%. While this is somewhat expected, we need to monitor closely the number of students who complete behind schedule. The impact of this creates an even greater challenge to students. The burden of having to repeat a course is multifaceted. These students are often devastated, the failure has a huge impact on their confidence. They are often financially challenged because they did not plan on being in school an extra semester or potentially an extra year. Their ability to get student loans is already a challenge due to the high number of college units to get into the program, and it delays their employment. The goal of the Nursing Student Success Coordinator is to identify and support these students to reduce the number of failures in all semesters of the program and increase on-time completions. The Student Success Program not only improves outcomes for currently enrolled students, but also allows for a full class of new students to enter the program each semester. This ultimately allows for more graduates, which in turn means more qualified RN’s in the workforce.

"To develop Multi-Camera LIVE TV Studio Production curriculum that models & reflects current film & TV industry standards in terms of workflow, latest technologies, on-set practices, production team collaboration & communication, current software & equipment. LIVE TV MULTI-CAMERA STUDIO ENVIRONMENT is necessary & beneficial for all students in the program to learn on-set protocol, soft & hard production skills, video control room functions &other studio operations inLIVE multi-camera production. ","The Media Arts Department at Glendale Community College is creating a state of the art Television and Film Production curriculum where students will be trained on the latest technologies in film and TV production, software, audio, camera, lighting, on-set etiquette and skills, and LIVE Multi-Camera TV Studio production.  Only through this training will individuals be ready to entire, or upgrade their skill set for the ever expanding workforce. The most effective, direct, and efficient teaching model for students to learn production skills that translate across all areas of Film and TV Production is with hands on, directly supervised instruction and application of knowledge in a TV Studio.

The Film and TV Industry needs people who have been trained in these various skill areas.  Glendale Community College seeks to train students to be competitive for and attain not only the projected new job openings but also our program seeks to offer a competitive edge and strong foundation for successful transfer into four year film, television or multi-media programs.

The Film and Television Sector is a thriving workforce which continues to grow. Los Angeles is already a hub of the Film and Television Industry, attracting individuals not only from the county but also from other states and countries. As indicated in the July 2017 report on “Agency Film Production” job growth in the Film and Television Industry in Los Angeles is projected to grow 12% by 2021. Through this project, we seek to be a key player in training individuals to be successful at attaining these new job openings, and for upgrading skill sets of their current positions for these higher level positions.  

Multi-Camera Production and Live TV Production are a vibrant sub-sector within the ever expanding Film, TV and Multi-Media Industries. The ultimate goal of this project is to train students in this particular arena (LIVE multi-camera production) not only so they can be successful in multi-camera film production but also because through the curriculum they will be offered the learning opportunity to be trained in a broad set of hard and soft skills that are in demand in a variety of jobs in all areas of the Film and Television Industry. There is tremendous interest in this field not only from students presently enrolled at Glendale Community College but also individuals living in the neighboring communities. Additionally, people from all over the world come to the Los Angeles area to work in the Film and TV industry and seek the job training our program offers.  

In order for students to be trained for the film and television production workforce they must have access to state of the art technologies so the department can model the workflow and practices of professional TV Studio and Film production in their curriculum and course work.  

The TV studio is the best and most efficient space to train the most numbers of students. Other institutions have already modeled this phenomenon. At CSUN, the Multi-Camera Television Studio supports a TV curriculum that serves significantly more students than the single camera production curriculum. The TV studio production courses facilitate an environment where faculty have uniquely direct opportunities to teach and model professional practices during class time.  It is the most efficient learning environment, path to job training and building necessary skills that will benefit students interested in all areas of the film and TV industry. 

Additionally, we plan to build up our TV program to incorporate very specific certificate programs and workshops focused on the specific skills needed for the various jobs descriptions within TV Production (switcher, media server, audio, camera operator, character generator, etc), thus students will have ample opportunity to gain hands on training on our state of the art equipment. With the support of industry role models and the CTE STEM Counselors, (including under represented) students will have more affirmation and exposure to opportunities.

"As an extension of the the Burdo Culinary Arts Center and the Culinary Arts Program, this proposal is for a culinary food trailer that will both expand student learning opportunities, but also support program outreach and student success. Students will be exposed to industry experts, real world work experience and entrepreneurship. ","The Culinary Arts Mobile Food Trailer will serve as an iconic and instantly-recognizable student recruitment tool for the SRJC Culinary Arts Program. Food trucks/trailers are “cool and hip” and appeal to millennials and entrepreneurs looking to enter the culinary industry. This Mobile Food Trailer will help us reach a demographic that has become less interested in Culinary Arts because of its “stuffy” reputation. We will make cooking cool again. We will increase student retention and completion. The food trailer course/content will be as a short add-on to the current culinary certificate and will encourage students to stay in the program. In this certificate, capstone work will be done during special events around the county including Shone Farm. This creates opportunities for technical instruction as well as an opportunity for students to meet industry professionals (chefs and catering directors) and make employment connections. This scenario will also support the return of “Skill Builders.” This project aligns with the industry here in Sonoma County Wine Country, an area that has multiple off-premise special events every week. The Culinary Arts industry advisory committee has identified this segment as growing rapidly, and there is huge demand for training in the areas of both special event catering and operation of mobile food trailers. Additionally, events can be planned and executed at Shone Farm, especially in conjunction with standing events such as the Fall Festival or the Agstravaganza, in order to highlight the Farm-to-Fork aspect of Sonoma County. Money raised by students in the Culinary Arts programs will go directly back into the program to support and sponsor current and future students through equipment grants, scholarships, and other opportunities to support student equity goals.

"The Help Me Grow project will ensure that that the highest-needs students have an equal opportunity to learn and grow in the field of Early Childhood Education. The projects vision is two-fold:
1)	to address the gaps in access to resources and support services that aid in the success of Child Development students and their educational goals

2)	to prepare Child Development students to compete in the workforce and contribute to the thriving South Bay community.","The Help Me Grow project will address the gaps in access to resources and support services to our most neediest students by providing a one-stop access point to—the Child Development Resource Room—which will be equipped with computers, resource books, professional journals, Child Development textbooks, children’s books, and preschool curriculum kits to assist students in locating age-appropriate resources for their class assignments or their work with children.
A statewide early childhood professional development and professional learning systems change is underway. Over the next five years, a fully developed and articulated statewide system plan of certification, preparation and support for California’s early childhood professionals with concrete objectives will create a real systems-level change. If Los Angeles Harbor College wants to transform the workforce for children birth through age 8, it is imminent that we prepare Child Development students for the systems change. The development of a one-stop access point [the CDRR] can serve as a roadmap for students, especially after a 2016-2017 survey unveiled that over 86% of Child Development students felt that the CD department did not provide them with adequate resources to support their educational goals. This survey also revealed the students’ uncertainty in LAHC’s Child Development certificates of achievement, associate in science and transfer degrees, and Child Development State permits and credentials. 
In two years, the Help Me Grow project will reduce the number of Child Development students who left the system without receiving any type of traditional outcome such as transfer to a four year college or completion of a degree or certificate. With 51% of LAHC students being Hispanic, the Help Me Grow Project will diversify its support services by providing resources in English and Spanish. The majority of underserved students often lack a strong support system, they struggle to balance degree requirements with their growing financial worries and complex job schedules, and have limited access to technology or required course materials. The project would improve student progress and outcomes by addressing the disparities that exist among our highest-needs students by closing the equity gaps at the course level and preparing our students for college. 

Furthermore, the project will develop a planning tool that will serve as a vessel to disseminate career information, study options, career opportunities, and potential salaries to current and perspective students. The project will house support services that provide Child Development students with a pathway for planning their program of study. In addition, the Child Development Resource Room (CDRR) will host a professional/facilitator who can provide one-on-one assistance in applying for certificates of achievement, associate in science and transfer degrees, and Child Development State permits and credentials. 
The CDRR will serve as a bridge that connects students to professionals in the field such as family child care homes, state-funded preschools, child care centers, corporate child care, non-profit organizations, and local community agencies that serve children and families. These entities will collaborate to bring workshops, career information sessions, professional development activities, story times, and art activities in English and Spanish.

d. Internship and job placement:  Students will be placed in unpaid or paid internship and WEX sites while taking classes in their programs of study.  Some internships may transition to paid jobs.  In any case, a specialist will assist students with job placement as they are completing certificate and degree programs.  LAMC is currently exploring options for data tracking that will stay current with jobs and wages.

e. Faculty development:  The needs for faculty development and training will vary by CE area.  Changes in technology, processes and practices will drive the need for the re-tooling of faculty in order to modify curriculum and courses that align to industry demands.  Faculty will attend workshops and trainings, and may participate in externships in specific industries to update their skills and to ensure curriculum is relevant and will produce students for sustainable careers that include opportunities for growth.

"The CIS program at Merritt College will increase the completion of more and better trained students by purchasing equipment to provide an isolated IT network to simulate computer and network attacked, upgrade existing training software, provide opportunities for work-based learning in the form of co-op ed and internships and update faculty skills and curriculum. 
","Need for Isolated IT Network
This project will result in an increase in student completions in the area of cyber security. There is a great need for trained specialists who can work to secure our nations computer and internet based systems.  We are trying to meet this need by providing equipment upgrades, professional development and curriculum design the will provide powerful learning opportunities for the student in our Computer Information Systems programs. The funding from this proposal will also support the purchase of an isolated IT network where students can be exposed to simulated system attacks. 

Software Need:
Merritt is already one of the highest users of Netlab, a shared hardware resource among community colleges which is used to give
student access to network equipment. Because it is shared, the process to develop and deploy new scenarios is very long. The new scenarios often exceed the capabilities of the shared hardware which is old and scheduled for a refresh since the deployed version has reached its end of life. This proposed effort will inform Netlab refresh and Merritt will add to the portfolio of scenarios regionally available.

Work-based Learning Opportunities:
Many employers such as Facebook, Kaiser Permanente, and McAfee ask students to complete interactive cybersecurity lab scenarios demonstrating the Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities (KSA) that are applicable in their company. These scenarios consists of interconnected computers and networks where there is a cybersecurity incident to be discovered or mitigated. These ""challenges"" often lead to placement in co-ops or internships. This proposal provides Merritt with the ability to create repeatable automated scenarios that let our students demonstrate requested KSA, secure paid internships, and earn required co-op credit toward completion of their certificate or degree.

Broaden Access & Exploration:
Many students do not have adequate computer equipment to explore activities through the Cybersecurity club, or complete program course work. Common cybersecurity tasks such as encryption/decryption and Virtual Machine usage cause student computers to fail. This impedes their progress or causes them to fall behind teammates and classmates. By providing all students access to the same computing resources hosted on a Virtual Machine server, students can engage in club, competition, and class activities on a level playing field. This project reduces the cost of participation for economically challenged students improving access, equity, and exploration. 

CTE Faculty (15) Enhance Professional Development
Faculty can improve their skill through classes offered by the Western Academy and Support Training Center (WASTC) such as ""Orientation to Netlab VE"". This proposal enables faculty to apply these skills through creation of new lab scenarios that reflect recent occurrences in Cybersecurity. These skills enhance regional resources because the new labs can be added to the portfolio of Cybersecurity labs that are part of the Bay Area Community College Consortium (BACCC) portfolio.",\n,\n,\n

SCC will hire a CE Dean to manage this space,  as well as other SWP projects focused on SWP outcomes.  ","We recently conducted a self-study to inform our understanding of these issues in the context of this project.  This study linked a drop in enrollments, low course completion and low graduation rates among our predominantly low-income students to their economic instability.  In addition, the study revealed low levels of literacy and other education gaps among students entering our programs, with cultural and language barriers posing a further challenge to degree completion.  There is limited campus access to technologies and tools needed to prepare these students for success in today’s workforce, as these tend to be isolated in specific programs and inaccessible to many who could benefit from participation in more broadly guided CE pathways.  Our analysis does show that SCC is a vibrant, ethnically diverse campus. However, we must endeavor to include more under-served populations in the STEM / STEAM / CE sectors. The evidence propelling this effort is both quantitative and qualitative.   More effectively differentiated CE pathways can provide access to living wages and upward mobility for these disproportionately impacted students.

To address these needs, our makerspace and digital fabrication lab will create a beachhead on our campus, where agents of change develop and implement innovative approaches to preparing our students for success. Creating an SCC campus “maker” culture, as part of a larger network of makers, will allow for more effective mentorship guiding students into CE pathways attuned to the new economy.  Skilled, well-paid, and socially aware, students will be adaptive, flexible and prepared for the challenges of an ever-changing technology-driven workplace. In addition, we are working withe Apple on an ""Everyone Can Code"" initiative through our interdisciplinary maker space.  A CE Dean will manage this space, pursue dual enrollment opportunities, lead the ""Everyone Can Code"" Initiative and manage SWP projects focused on SWP Outcomes.  

Our new facility will position SCC as a regional hub for innovation that prepares disproportionately impacted populations for the needs of a modern workforce.  We are focused on equity and access for all of our stakeholders and will drive innovation in education as we prepare our CCC students for success in STEM/STEAM and ICT careers that demand 21st Century skills. We are also working with Apple on the creation of a Coding Hub to support our Everyone Can Code initiative.  To ensure effectiveness and ensure a campus wide focus a CE Dean will be hired.

Pharmacy Technician was the first program to develop and implement the NOCE noncredit I-BEST model, where we pair a CTE instructor with an academic support instructor. This model helps students get the help they need while studying in the career field of their choice to help accelerate their progression of developing career readiness skills so they can move quickly into a living wage job. Student outcomes data demonstrates increased student success in I-BEST classes. Beyond providing students additional support through our I-BEST model to increase student success there are four main success factors that contribute to a Pharmacy Technician student’s ability to obtain employment after training which include: at least 180 hours of externship experience; smaller hands-on simulation labs; employability skills training (soft skills); and industry recognized Pharmacy Technician certification. NOCE will be meeting the employability skills training through classroom training and opportunities offered under our Strong Workforce – Workforce Preparation and Advancement Strategy. We will continue to offer workshops, one-on-one sessions, as well as create an Employment Readiness Center. The four (4) areas we would address under our Pharmacy Technician Employment Readiness/Certifications strategy include: development and implementation of an improved out-patient simulation lab in accordance with ASHP accreditation requirements; continuation of the test prep courses that include the purchase of and access to the PTCB practice exams and certification vouchers; release time for the Pharmacy Technician Full-Time Faculty Director to continue to recruit sites, complete site visits, and increase student access for student externships; and curriculum development hours for Pharmacy Technician faculty to revise curriculum to match the new ASHP National Accreditation Standards and align with industry requirements. In Spring 2018, NOCE was informed b the national ASHP Accreditation board that there will be changes to the accreditation requirements and curriculum standards. Therefore, to ensure that NOCE maintains its national accreditation, faculty will re-write existing curriculum and create new curriculum that will meet and/or exceed the new standards and curriculum requirements of the pharmacy technician industry and ASHP.

"Recognizing regional and state-wide mandates to increase student success, completion, job placement, job retention, and employer engagement for all CTE programs and students; NOCE is proposing to continue with their first year Workforce Preparation and Advancement Strategy to provide these additional skill sets and engagement to motivate students to take noncredit CTE programs, complete their chosen program, gain employment, and continue on their chosen pathway to further advancement.","SCE serves a vital role within the North Orange County region in creating an entry point for all adult students, especially those high-risk, underserved populations to gain access to post-secondary education and career technical training was well as a jumping point to moving on to more advanced educational opportunities at both Cypress and Fullerton colleges.

As with Career Technical Education (CTE) credit programs, SCE designs noncredit CTE programs to ensure students are prepared with the necessary technical skills required for the occupation for which they trained. While our noncredit certificate programs include strong technical skills within the curriculum, gaps have been identified in the effective preparation of employability “soft” skills; understanding of the available pathways from education to employment and advancement; an emphasis and availability of credentials and licensing; employer engagement with students; and job placement. 

This second (2nd) year of funding will allow us the opportunity to continue to build the infrastructure and resources needed to scale up some of the regional AEBG best practices in Workforce Development by expanding access to underserved populations within the SCE CTE programs as well as address key components identified through program review, advisory meetings and student feedback as major gaps in our existing programs and services.

1.	Connections to employers and industry partners for responsive programs, curriculum and engagement with students.
2.	Integration of employability skills and technical skills within noncredit CTE programs.
3.	Development of a comprehensive social and academic support services program.

The funding will be used to support the activities and services of this strategy including, but not limited to:

•	Hiring professional experts to develop curriculum, provide professional development for faculty for the integration of employability/soft skills into course materials, conduct student workshops on career pathways, employability/soft skills, industry related training and information, assist with the implementation of grant funded activities, etc.
•	Creation and presentation of employability/soft skills tools and training materials
•	Integration of employability skills into noncredit CTE program classes and programs
•	Continued development and implementation of career-related events and fairs, such as a capstone workforce day event
•	Continued development and implementation of workforce related workshops and guest speaker program 
•	Continued development and maintenance of an online student employment link/job posting site that gives students access to full-time, part-time and volunteer opportunities
•	Assistance to CTE faculty for the engagement of external partners to ensure responsive curriculum and programs to increase student career opportunities
•	Explore additional externship and internship opportunities for noncredit CTE students
•	Continued development of additional partnerships with local workforce and community agencies to deliver a comprehensive social and academic support services program to our students
•	Continued development and implementation of data collection methods to track student progress on obtaining and maintaining employment

By receiving a second year of funding, this plan will continue to improve our ability to: increase the quality of our existing CTE programs by creating new opportunities for business and employer engagement and expanding partnership opportunities with local business and community agencies; develop new and/or expand noncredit CTE offerings to meet regional needs and demands; increase the number of students who achieve successful workforce outcomes by developing career-readiness skill workshops, resources, capstone activities, additional career exploration opportunities, and increasing student engagement with local employers and industry experts; expanding professional development opportunities for faculty and students; increasing the number of students who are able to gain and maintain employment after completion of training programs.

"The Medical Assistant program prepares students for an entry-level position as a medical assistant in a front office (administrative) and back office (clinical setting). The program consists of a sequence of courses that prepares students with the knowledge of skills needed to perform the tasks of a medical assistant in keeping the office of physicians, podiatrist, chiropractors, and other health practitioners running smoothly.","During the 2012-2013 and 2013-2014 school year, NOCE received an Industry Driven Regional Collaboration grant to expand the capacity of our medical assistant program and increase student employment. As part of this grant funding, we were able to offer qualifying students vouchers to complete the National Healthcareer Association (NHA) Clinical Medical Assistant Certification exam. Approximately 90% of students completing the program took the certification exam. When that funding ended, NOCE continued to promote the certification exam, however, the rate dropped significantly and now there are approximately only 5-10% of students completing our program report taking this industry recognized certification exam.

Although certification is not currently required to work as a medical assistant, the regional medical assisting advisory group has identified it as a key success factor in students gaining employment. Additionally, discussions are occurring throughout the state to mandate certification in the near future for all healthcare workers.

In an effort to increase the number of graduating students who take and pass the certification exam, our full-time faculty member, began a partnership with the Orange County Healthcare Deputy Sector Navigator to offer NHA review classes. SCE ran its first review class in fall 2015, which was attended by approximately 38% of our graduating class (35 of 92 students). It was reported by the faculty and CTE staff that many of the students completing the review course did not have the funds to take the certification exam. Additionally, approximately 30% of the students invited to take the free review course opted out due to the inability to pay the certification exam fees.

To increase access to and successful completion of the NHA certification exam, we propose to: develop a process for students to be eligible to receive vouchers for either the practice exam and review materials, the certification exam or both; develop a self-sustaining way to implement a review course for the NHA exam; and purchase NHA practice exams and certification vouchers.

If funded, this would increase the percentage of students who take and pass industry recognized certification that leads to successful workforce outcomes.

In fact, Registered Nurses (RN), Licensed Vocational Nurses (LVN), Emergency Medical Technicians (EMT), and Paramedics have been consistently identified in the top 100 occupations based on projected needs, with RN’s identified with the highest annual openings. In addition, the health and long term care needs of our aging population, including increased medical emergencies; growing numbers of people accessing the healthcare system due to the recent reforms in healthcare; the anticipated acceleration of retirements of healthcare workers, and the subsequent job vacancy forecast, all lead to a dismal projection in providing qualified trained healthcare professionals. (https://www.labormarketinfo.edd.ca.gov (2017).

In the 2016-17 academic year, 315 students completed a certificate, averaging approximately 5 completions per program. More than a third of the certificate programs had no completers. The goal of this project is to increase the number of students who complete an existing CTE certificate program. 

Adult learners may be more successful if they can enroll in courses through a cohort model. This approach enables them to progress with a group of familiar students, take courses at the same location and time each week, and have access to a book loan program, significantly reducing the cost of the program. They will know the sequence of each course and an identified completion date for the program.

The project will fund a FT Instructional Designer who will design dynamic online modules that CTE faculty can customize for their programs, building a resource infrastructure for CTE and later for other faculty. A part-time Program Specialist will coordinate orientation, cohort enrollment, and support services. As students are successful in each course, they will continue to enroll in the next program course, increasing FTES (potentially, 20 students completing each of 8 – 12 courses). With the support and structure of a cohort model, program completion rates will improve from an average of 5 students per program to an average of 12-15 students per program.

"Drone use is regulated and pilots must receive training. This project provides training to faculty at multiple colleges through a summer institute. ","The usage of unmanned aerial systems (drones) in industry is expanding rapidly. Industries adding drones in their workflows include agriculture, public safety, film production, journalism, industrial inspection, commercial photography, civil engineering, and many others. Bay area community college programs are well-placed to address several of these areas. In order to maximize the efforts of these colleges, they need to work together to produce appropriate programs and courses. In order to facilitate this cooperation, communication between colleges is vital. Using 2016-2017 SWP funding, SRJC held the Bay Area Drone Symposium in June, 2017. Representatives from over 15 colleges and high schools in the Bay Area region met to discuss the beginnings of a partnership of curriculum and program sharing. In addition, the 2016-2017 SWP funding provided for the development of SRJC’s drone course, CS 76.11 Commercial Drone Imaging. The first offering of this class in Fall 2017 is nearing successful completion, and two sections are scheduled for Spring 2018.

"The Student Accessibilities Services (SAS) at Merritt College provides college access and success opportunities to the lower quadrant of underprepared students impacted by disabilities.  SAS will deploy a non-credit pathway that includes developmental writing, math and career skills to increase access and success for this student population. ","We have long been unprepared for students who graduate from local high schools that are not ready academically for college-level coursework.  Some have just not been paying attention while others may have significant physical, intellectual or mental health challenges which keep them from having been successful in the past.  We believe that by developing contexualized basic skills courses into a guided pathway and small certificate program, we can provide enough support and momentum to improve the opportunities for access, retention and the success of this student population. 

This proposal is an attempt to provide opportunities for success to the lower quadrant of underprepared students who are impacted by disabilities.  The approach is intentional as it brings together the Oakland Unified School District who is a major feeder to the community college who has advocated for supportive pathways for our student population.  In addition, this collaboration includes the State of California Department of Rehabilitation who is supporting the students as clients to obtain a certificate that would provide opportunities encouraging the students to integrate into the workforce or continue their education.  Moreover, the goal for the Department of Rehabilitation is to assist with employment placement.  

The Department of SAS at Merritt College understands the challenges and concerns the community partners have presented.  SAS has met multiple times with the partners to discuss their needs and how we can work together to increase the success of our students.  As a result, SAS has developed a non-credit pathway that includes developing writing, math and career skills in response to this request as an actionable plan to increase student access and success. DSP will provide Counseling, embedded tutoring, tutors, learning disability assessment if needed, and reasonable accommodations. This approach has an intentional foundation to provide a safety net that would allow students to be successful in achieving their educational goals. Once they complete the cluster of classes students can either apply to entry-level positions, or they can continue their education at Merritt College.

"PRISim Force Options Simulators are training tools used by law enforcement.  It is basically an interactive video presentation that puts students in a potentially dangerous situation.  The outcome of the scenario is determined by the actions of the student.  There are over 500 different scenarios included in the program, so students will be put in many different situations.  the Administration of Justice Advisory Board has discussed, approved and is in support of the purchase of the system.","Training of peace officers requires the ability to present students with various every day scenarios they are likely to encounter on the job.  The PRISim Force Options Simulator will give the student that ability in a safe, educational way.  Does the situation call for deadly force or can the officer reason with the suspect?  Students have the ability to try different tactics with each scenario and the outcome will change with each new tactic.  This gives our Administration of Justice students a rare opportunity to learn correct protocol.  PRISim can be used for report writing and criminal investigation too.  The students would watch a scenario and write a report or the student would have to identify evidence and determine what evidence should be used in a criminal matter.

Our needs and solutions include:
- Previously our histotech students were able to access employment even prior to completing a clinical rotation.  However, regulatory changes in the field have occurred which make this difficult.  At the same time, obtaining affiliate partnerships for clinical rotations is a long and difficult process, so there is a bottleneck for students, after course completion.  We are deploying extra support this year to accelerate the number clinical rotations available overall so that our students can meet their employment goals.
- Our marketing materials are outdated and ineffective: we will revitalize them to increase enrollment and we will also provide a networking and career information database for our students.
- Histotech will pilot innovative video instruction, in collaboration with Kaiser Permanente, to increase program capacity and serve students that work night shifts or have long commutes to campus.
- Work-based learning is key to employability in Biotech: we will revitalize our once very successful, but now dormant, microscopy internship program.
- Contract Service Organizations affiliated with Biotech programs have proven to be vital for
employability: we will establish a structure for Profile Histotech, Profile Microscopy, Profile
Genomics.
-	Our Advisory Board and students agree that there is a need for increased hands-on, lab time for microtomy before graduation, so we will provide open labs with instructors and also increase the number of lab hours in the core courses.
- In microscopy we only have Certificates of Proficiency:  we will grow our program by adding a long needed Certificate of Achievement in Microscopy.
-	Our microscopy and histotech equipment and imaging software is in need of updating, after ten years of operation; we will also purchase equipment that will allow us to expand the number of hands-on lab stations for our students.

This project aims to capitalize on the state and regional efforts to change this perception while increasing the number of potential students in existing and emerging CTE programs throughout our district. We need to fund this project in order to increase the quantity of CTE students by increasing the CTE course fill-rate by 2-4% per year (which also produces a corresponding increase in the number of CTE students enrolled in GE courses). For 2016-2017,
the 26 CTE TOP Coded programs at Cypress College had an average fill-rate of 81.3%, which was below the campus other (non-CTE) course average of 88.5%. The CTE fill-rate at Fullerton was 79.6%. Therefore, there is an opportunity to increase CTE productivity and program stability without adding faculty or classes. Next, at Cypress College, CTE degrees account for about 45% of degrees, and CTE certificates account for 98% of all certificates issued. A corresponding 2-4% increase in awards is projected as well. Finally, our CTE programs currently compete with many proprietary schools that have slick online marketing campaigns and search engine optimization metrics that actively seek out potential students.

"The Medical Assisting program is responding to a local need in Oakland to provide Certified Nursing Assistant and home health care assistant. In addition we are upgrading our equipment and will be working closely with our advisory council to ensure our program curriculum meets industry standards and needs.","The medical assisting program (MEDAS) at Merritt college has been approached by various bay area health partners to develop a Certified Nursing Assisting program. There is a need in the Oakland community and because of our experience in the Medical Assisting program, we are in a position to support this opportunity. In order to continue move forward with this inititative we need to update our equipment, increase student workers to handle clerical duties and purchase software to simulate medical assisting and CNA diagnosis and patient reporting tasks. In addition, we need to purchase new and updated instructional equipment.  ",\n,\n,\n
"The Early Childhood Development program will develop wrap around advising and support for student seeking to complete the certificate and licensing requirements for employment in Child Development Educational positions. ","We are requesting funds to sustain and improve the highly successful CHDEV certificate and permit support program. This program began as a regional Alameda County collaboration; after 3 years of documenting the successful efforts to support students in completing certificates and licenses we are now proposing to institutionalize this program with Strong Work Force funding. Due to the services provided in this project, the number of certificates increased from 40 in 2012-13 to 289 in 2015-2016. The number of students receiving their CHDEV advisory guides also increased significantly within this time frame from 200 to over 300.
 
The successful increased completion is based on the critical duties of the CHDEV staff assistant. The position requires detailed knowledge of the certificate and licensing process and one-on-one advising and course completion planning with students. Because students in this area are in multiple classes together with the small set of the same faculty, they become in a sense a cohort where it is easier to require them to see the Staff Assistant in this position several times during a semester and thus maintain close contact and records. In addition, the position requires detailed tracking of data and knowledge of certificate, permit and licensing application procedures. 

Career Pathway #3
The CHDEV has developed a Career Pathways interactive map with multiple entry points from the CHDEV/Vessel ESL courses through the AST degree (please see attached).  With this map, the staff assistant will work with 500+ students in increasing the certification and licensing completion rates. Faculty on special assignment will do presentations in all Child Development classes and outreach to providers in Northern Alameda County.

"We are proposing to develop a Statistics/Data Science Pathway at West Valley College.  This pathway would allow students to complete all lower division pre-statistics requirements for transfer to a CSU, UC, or private universities.  We would develop and articulate curriculum for new coursework needed so that students could start major work as soon as they transfer.","According to a recent survey, an increasing number of employers in both the public and private sectors are adding jobs for statisticians and data analysts but are having a difficult time finding qualified candidates.   Fortune 500 identifies statistics as the fastest-growing STEM major in the US and LinkedIn recently listed data analysis as the most in-demand skill in a recent survey.  Currently there are not enough people with this background to fill the job demand.  The McKinsey Global Institute predicts a shortage of up to 190,000 people with the data analysis skills to work with “Big Data” and in a recent survey of employers conducted by the Society for Human Resource Management, 78% of survey respondents reported having difficulty recruiting qualified candidates for data analyst positions.

Statistics is one of the fastest growing degree programs at 4-year universities, and an increasing number of universities are adding majors or minors in data science as well.  Very few community colleges, however, have clear pathways into the statistics and data science majors.  Since community college serve close to ½ of all undergraduates in the US, including a majority of African-American and Hispanic students, it is vital that community colleges provide access to this growing career field to our students.  

Currently students can transfer into a statistics major; however, at many schools they would have to take additional classes before being able to start their upper division work.  We would develop and articulate curriculum for new coursework needed so that students could start major work as soon as they transfer.  In addition since, unlike many 4-year institutions, the community college does not have a separate Statistics Department the Statistics/Data Science Pathway would provide higher visibility to these majors, as well as opportunities to explore careers in these fields.  It would also be an excellent marketing tool for our college, as there are no colleges in our area that have this pathway.",\n,\n,\n

"The Strong Workforce investment will be allocated to continue funding a full-time faculty position in Agribusiness, with an emphasis in food safety, who will continue to create and maintain new pathways to completion. These pathways include: industry recognized certificates, Associate of Science degrees and 2 + 2 baccalaureate degree partnerships with universities.","The Agricultural Science industry is in need of food safety workers and experts who understand and are able to implement the mandates of the Food Safety Modernization Act.

"DevOps the use of software DEVelopment tools to automate Information Systems OPerations requires Knowledge Skills and Abilities (KSA) are too broad for a single college or district to
teach. DevOpsNation is a collaborative program which allows regional adaptation to rapidly changing technology via multi-college shared ownership and guided pathways increase
completion rates.

","DevOps is a software engineering culture and practice that aims at unifying software development (DEV) and software operations (OPS). The main characteristic of the DevOps movement is to strongly advocate automation and monitoring at all steps of software construction, from integration, testing, and releasing, to deployment and infrastructure management. DevOps aims at shorter development cycles, increased deployment frequency and more dependable releases in close alignment with business objectives. Many of the components of Information Systems (IS) infrastructure that is used to enable business operations are now available through a subscription model. Companies such as Microsoft, Google, and IBM provide hosted solutions in the form of: Infrastructure as a service (IAAS): a form of Cloud computing that provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. It provides high level Application Programming Interfaces (API) to control components such as Virtual Local Area Networks (VLAN) and Virtual Machines (VM) individually or as members of a pool. This permits creation of infrastructure that scales in response to usage. Software as a Service (SAAS): A licensing and delivery model in which software is centrally hosted. It si sometimes referred to as ""on-demand"" for many business applications including office software, messaging software, payroll processing software, CAD software etc. Platform as a Service (PAAS): A category of cloud computing that delivers pre-configured servers or resources permitting users to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building, installing, configuring, and maintaining suites of information technology components. Each of these categories of Information Systems (IS) resources represents an aggregation of underlying Information Technology components: servers, software, configuration files, data files, VLANs, etc. In order to manage these new categories of IS resources, a student needs to have mastered the underlying technologies as well as the APIs that permit these services to be orchestrated. This is the task of the DevOps curriculum: Instructing students in the underlying IT components, Instructing them in the assembly of IT components into business ready Information Systems, and Instructing them in creation and control of these components using the APIs provided by many candidate service providers. DevOps is at the center of rapid transformation in software development and IT operations. An increasingly complex software development cycle, explosive growth in data, and distribution of services means that students must acquire Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities (KSA) that are too broad for any one college to teach and consistently update. This proposal combines DevOps applicable courses from participating colleges into a certificate and degree program. These courses stack onto the IT Model Curriculum in a guided pathway which has been shown to increase completion rates among African American and Hispanic/Latino students. Program will leverage shared BACCC Netlabs infrastructure to supplement existing pods and scenarios with new DevOps specific scenarios. Shared MOUs drive and secure enrollment at each college balancing supply and demand and leveraging other RJV investments. Fundamental to the success of our student-centered design is expanding the geography and breadth of curriculum through Bay Area regional community college collaboration. The shared DevOps curriculum follows the IT Curriculum model where program applicable courses can be implemented at participating college using the same outline. Colleges are encouraged to develop a specialty and implement courses beyond those that are part of the guided pathway. If a college has already implemented the ITMC, students who complete these courses have already earned program applicable credits towards a DevOps degree or certificate. The proposal aligns with several ""Projects in Common"" as identified by the state chancellor's office and provides opportunities to leverage other RJVs for direct student benefit. This proposal provides for more efficient employer engagement by coordinating input on program applicable curriculum through regional working groups. Participating employers then commit to providing Subject Matter Experts (SME) with the Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities (KSA) they want students enrolled in a course to gain. These SME are part of a regional pool available to participating colleges to co-teach as guest speakers with existing college faculty. This provides professional development opportunities for the faculty as they will likely be ready to teach the course alone after a few semesters of co-teaching with various SMEs. This provides the opportunity for each college to ""grow-their-own"" DevOps faculty and enables the relatively small pool of highly-skilled SME to have regional impact. The program also partners with regional organizations that have a mission-task focus on candidate interview readiness and placement. It leverages the work of <Tech/Hire>: Oakland, part of a national placement organization with regional branches that maintain a hyper-local focus on broadening access and placement of candidates from underrepresented demographics. They help employers align entry level positions with the program's KSA and provide material to counselors at participating colleges so they can properly advise students about career pathways. They also interface with the DevOps RJV interview readiness partner OutCo.io who prepare program candidates for technical interviews and provide support through the offer & salary negotiation phases of placement. The DevOps RJV avoids creation of prep and placement centers within each college or district instead relying on regional efforts that already exist. The work done for students by <Tech/Hire>: Oakland can be replicated to <Tech/Hire>: San Francisco or any of the 72 other regional <Tech/Hire> placement centers. The instruction will utilize shared infrastructure such as the Bay Area Community College Consortium (BACCC) Netlab. Some of the initial DevOps pathways consists of existing courses that are currently taught using Netlab. Other DevOps pathways that require VMs and VLANs that exceed the capacity of such a widely shared platform (28 Colleges simultaneously) will run on a separate shared network; a pilot with the intention of discovering the resource requirements that would enable DevOps VMs to be deployed on the next generation of BACCC Netlab infrastructure. The outcomes of this pilot will be shared with another RJV ""BACCC NETLAB+ Shared ICT Data Center"" The chosen partners for this RJV also share a mission for improving Diversity in Tech. <Tech/Hire> Oakland receives support from Opportunity@Work which has the mission of expand access. Opportunity@work is a national program that engages with regional <Tech/Hire> communities to transform hiring practices & uncover talent from nontraditional talent pools. Outco.io provides a software engineering technical interview and skill validation platform that includes options for a multi-week Tech+non-Tech curriculum. Once students are ready for placement the program provides for the acquisition of inter-personal skills necessary to land an offer. The guided pathway design for degree and certificate programs has been shown to increase completion and retention rates among African-American students by 33% and Hispanic/Latino students by 35%. The Collaborative DevOps Guided Pathway Regional Joint Venture puts all of the components in place to increase diversity in program participation and employment outcomes for this fast growing occupation.",\n,\n,\n

"This is a proposal to create a new Instructional Lab Technician position for the Department of Design and is intended to serve the areas of: Architecture, Landscape Architecture, Interior Design, Apparel Design, Apparel Technology, Web and Mobile Design, Marketing and Digital Communications, and Graphic Design.  The position will support all students in these CTE areas.","Generally, the Department of Design labs are under-utilized by and inaccessible to the students. Each lab contains complex equipment, both analog and digital. For example, The Fashion Design Computer Pattern making Lab  is currently open only when classes are held. No additional lab hours are available for students to practice their skills outside the regularly scheduled class hours.  Students must spend time on their homework, but the equipment needed to complete most of this homework is in this lab, thus preventing students from completing their work.   The un-availability of lab hours causes unnecessary hardship for students, especially those who are academically challenged, have learning disabilities, students from low socio-economic background, or just need more practice than the norm. In order to ensure student success and completion, it is crucial for the department to offer significant additional lab hours outside the class time. This proposal directly contributes to the College's mission of supporting students in reaching their career goals. 

Right now, we do have a Design Resource Lab (DRC), but this lab serves primarily Architecture and Interior Design students. It is intended to be expanded to serve Digital Media students as well. This lab is underutilized due the inability of these departments having no time to create a highly productive space for students to work in. Monitoring student needs and computer equipment would be the primary job in this space. We plan to add additional digital equipment in this space to expand student output capacity and will need direct supervision. An example would be the addition of a rack of 3D printers which require staff to ensure proper operation and to prevent damage by well-intentioned students. Additionally, this position would assist students and faculty in maintaining their material libraries.

With ?ve computer classrooms, we will use a portion of this position to make sure these classrooms are in good operating order. We have coordinated this request with WVC IT and they have agreed that it would work better if there was one contact person that the teaching faculty go to with issues confronting each individual lab classroom.

"This project will develop a food safety and water quality plan for Shone Farm, fund professional development for faculty and staff, and integrate food safety and water quality topics into the sustainable agriculture and animal science program curriculum.","Food safety and water quality regulations are becoming more stringent with the implementation of the federal Food Safety and Modernization Act (FSMA) and the new application of statewide water quality regulations for confined animal facilities to small equine and livestock operations. SRJC faculty, Shone Farm staff, and students in the Sustainable Agriculture and Animal Science programs will need to understand these new regulations and how they apply to farms and ranches in Sonoma County and throughout California.  
1) Food safety and water quality plan: Shone Farm will develop a comprehensive food safety and water quality plan for our existing garden and future livestock operations. Staff will contribute and we will also enlist a consultant to assist in developing a full set of Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs) and other standard operating procedures for the garden and livestock units at Shone Farm. These GAPs and SOPs will serve as teaching tools for the Sustainable Agriculture and Animal Science students. 
2)	Professional development: Shone Farm staff and Ag/Natural Resource faculty will go through several food safety-oriented training programs, including the FSMA Produce Rule; HACCP (Hazard Access Critical Control Point); California GAP requirements for AB 224 (CSA Law) and AB 1871 (Farmers Markets); and the confined animal regulations pertaining to water quality. 
3)	Curriculum development: Sustainable Agriculture and Animal Science Faculty will integrate relevant food safety and water quality topics into their existing curriculum. 

Agriculture/Natural Resources Dean Benjamin Goldstein will provide project management and be responsible for data collection and reporting on Strong Workforce metrics. Shone Farm manager Leonard Diggs will oversee farm staff training and the development of the Shone Farm GAP documentation. Sustainable Agriculture Program Coordinator Joshua Beniston and Animal Science Program Coordinator Amy Houseman will participate in professional development and perform the curriculum development.

"De Anza College's Film/TV: Production program strives to prepare students for the full range of employment opportunities within the film and television production industries. The program will use Strong Workforce Program (SWP) funding to improve student access to the most up-to-date resources and professional equipment. Without consistent refreshes of technology and equipment, our students will not be using the same sort of materials they will encounter in the real world. ","In order enhance efficiency and expand student access to equipment and facilities, the Film/TV: Production program proposes to use SWP funding to purchase WebCheckout, a computerized equipment and room reservation system. The WebCheckout sytems allow Film/TV faculty and staff to develop an inventory for the large amount of equipment our department owns and develop a secure and efficient way for students to checkout equipment for use and make reservations for production and post-production studios. Webcheckout would allow both groups to make both equipment and room reservations as well as track checkouts by students. Additionally, right now, we have no metrics on our equipment usage and knowing exactly what students are using the most (or not using) will help us better address their concerns. Overall, allowing computerized reservations increases access for everyone, since at this time, you need to make a reservation in person for any equipment checkout, limiting the options for many students.

In addition to the WebCheckout system software, Film/TV: Production also proposes to purchase camera stabilization equipment; such as a Movi gimbal, sliders, 3-axis gimbals, and a  jib. These items are frequently used on professional sets with the increased use of DSLR and lightweight cinema cameras. Knowing how to operate these complicated devices will help our students navigate these items when they encounter them on set. They will also help students produce more professional class projects, as the videos they make will benefit from this equipment.

Similarly to enhance the audio component of students' work, Film/TV: Production proposes using SWP funding to acquire a number of Sennheiser ultimate shotgun microphone kits. By purchasing five (5) of these kits, the program will have enough microphones to offer access to students enrolled in the Beginning Video Production (F/TV 20)  courses. Currently, their films suffer because though we offer camera equipment for rental, there is no comparable sound equipment access. These microphones will give those students more professional end products. as well as teach them the sound workflows they will need to know on and off set.

ESL students would attend the Career Track ESL Lab in conjunction with their career education courses. The Lab would give students the opportunity to discuss questions, concerns, and needs for review of concepts in their career education classes; as well as learning skills applicable to all careers. ","According to the state of California’s Employment Development Department (EDD, 2016), more than 80,000 people of San Diego and Imperial County are unemployed, making up 4.9% of the total population. 23.8% of the total population in these counties is foreign born, and 16% have a low proficiency of English. What's more, the EDD’s (2016) data tables report that more than 500,000 individuals in San Diego and Imperial counties claim English proficiency as a barrier to employment [U.S. Census bureau/Southern-Border RPU Summary]. This quantitative information comes from Regional Economic Analysis Profiles collected for the purpose of connecting workforce institutions and programs with the needs of various industries in the economic market in order to stimulate job opportunities and fulfillment of job positions in specific fields. The non-credit Career Track ESL courses at MiraCosta's Community Learning Center (CLC) provide a high-level of language proficiency training, useful for success in career education courses preparing students for employment. The courses focus on English development for the workplace, as well as the academic, career and life planning skills needed to navigate a career pathway through career education programs and future job opportunities. 

More specifically, this project to develop a Career Track ESL Lab course addresses the needs of students who have English as a second language by focusing on the support of career skills, while assisting students enrolled in MiraCosta’s career education programs. While ESL students attend the Career Track ESL Lab in conjunction with their career education courses, they will be given the opportunity to discuss questions, concerns, and needs for review of concepts in their career education classes; as well as learning skills applicable to all careers. The funds needed for this project would support the collaborative development of contextualized ESL materials by the ESL and discipline faculty members, and support meetings and discussions between departments concerning the challenges and shortcomings that ESL students in these specific career education-courses often face.

"This project will map current career pathways from high schools and adult schools to community colleges and conduct activities with prospective students in local middle schools and high schools to aid in their understanding of the educational options, pathways, and services available, and to facilitate enrollment.  Implementation activities include: (1) comprehensive mapping of existing career pathways; (2) coordinated student engagement; and (3) professional development for K-14 counselors. ","Regional needs: Employers have difficulty filling jobs due to a lack of qualified applicants. Employers report that students do not have the needed job readiness skills or soft skills. These skills can include adaptive, analysis/solution mindset, collaboration, communication, digital fluency, an entrepreneurial mindset, empathy, resilience, self-awareness, and social/diversity awareness. 

There is no regional articulation of Career Education (CE) courses and programs, although there is articulation across some high school and community college partners. The San Diego/Imperial region has developed some career pathways through the SB 1070 CE Regional Pathways work and through two CCPT grants working to develop career pathways in specific sectors. However, not all programs offer work-based learning or integrate work readiness into the coursework. Students get different levels of access to programs across the region, depending on where they live. Because there is considerable student mobility around the region, it is critical that students have portable credentials and courses so that they can continue on their pathway if they have to change schools.

Each college has its own career services system, which is usually isolated from course content, educational planning and CE leadership. Many community college students do not access career planning and guidance services until they are close to leaving the institution, whether by graduation or by deciding to leave to pursue work. Each college in the region offers some career services which may include career exploration materials and counselors available to students who make their way to the office to seek assistance. Colleges may offer in-person individual and group career counseling. Colleges may also offer a series of job fairs and workshops each semester on career exploration and related topics. In addition, most colleges provide access to online career exploration information and materials on their websites. Many also provide access to online workshops on a range of topics. 

In many majors, students must initiate career planning; it is not always integrated into their CE coursework. Most community college career services require the student to initiate the job search, rather than having career exploration and workplace skills development integrated into the institution's CE courses and ongoing student planning and information systems. Because many students attend more than one institution, students need to be able to transport their career and educational plans among the region's colleges.

In 2017 the SDIC Consortium contracted with WestEd to research and analyze the current status of career pathways and employment readiness in the region. Their research and analysis revealed that while students are persisting in individual courses, they are not completing full pathways within their selected career area. Only 34 percent enroll in aligned course in subsequent terms, and 13 percent remain within the pathway across any of the colleges within the SDIC region. WestEd noted that the populations of San Diego and Imperial Counties and their community college students have pressing needs for robust, differentiated instructional and support services to ensure student persistence and long-term success:
•	Over one-third of the population in the region lives at or near poverty levels.
•	34 percent of the population over 25 (over 750,000 adults) holds a high school diploma or less.
•	46 percent of community college students are over the age of 25; 32 percent are between the ages of 20-24; and 22 percent are age 19 or less. This youngest group appears to be growing.
•	Approximately 38 percent of students in the region are “first generation” college students.
•	Across the ten colleges, 5 to 38 percent of students took one or more credit or noncredit ESL courses.

Approach to address needs. WestEd noted that the “Guided Pathways” approach can help support student success and equitable outcomes — whether certificates, employment, or transfer — by providing structured course sequences, careful intake and planning processes, rich learning opportunities, and robust support services. At the core of this approach is fundamental reconfiguration of the college experience that focuses on student needs and provides “intrusive” or proactive direction that guides students to completion and success. Three regional colleges are currently working with the California Guided Pathways project to develop guided pathways. 

There are four pillars in the guided pathways approach: clarify the path; enter the path; stay on the path; ensure learning. WestEd recommended adding a fifth pillar – employment preparation and transitions – to create Guided Career Pathways.  Rather than working with a subset of students, Guided Pathways is a collegewide undertaking that provides a framework for integrating all of the California-based initiatives. Regional approaches, especially for business engagement processes, can enhance alignment of the Guided Pathways approach with Strong Workforce goals. 

Through their research WestEd identified several key system components as critical for student success in college, employment, further education, and long-term careers. These components are closely aligned with those supported by the Guided Pathways initiative, with additional emphasis on career-related experiences and employment services. The key system components include:

•	Pre-enrollment engagement: activities conducted prior to matriculation with prospective students to facilitate enrollment, and aid in their understanding of the educational options, pathways, and services available. 

•	Matriculation and comprehensive assessment: the process of enrolling in a community college and completing the necessary assessments and plans to pursue a pathway. 

•	Career exploration: a process of learning about career options through workshops, classes, tours, career-related research projects, informational interviews, and job shadows, based on identified interests and goals.

•	Career planning: development of a career plan, which includes a student’s interests, skills, and values, the career options that the student is interested in pursuing, and the educational and work-related experiences that will lead to one or more long-term career goals. 

•	Education planning: development of an education plan, which includes the documentation of the courses needed for a student to complete a specific degree, certificate, or transfer program of study and fulfill their educational goals, both at the community college level and beyond.

•	Pathway participation and career preparation: engagement with the courses and experiences offered in a career pathway. 

•	Applied and work-based learning (WBL): strategies that deepen learning and support career awareness, career exploration, and career preparation through engagement with employers and real work opportunities. 

•	Student supports: the full range of services needed to successfully complete pathways including tutoring, testing for special education, peer study groups, assessment and accessibility supports for students with disabilities, and nonacademic supports for personal needs such as just-in-time housing services, transportation and parking, food and nutrition, child care, financial assistance, and other subsidies. 

•	Employment preparation and transition: activities that prepare students to transition into further education, formal training, and/or the workforce such as resume writing, interview skills, job search services, letters of recommendation, and feedback and coaching opportunities.

This project addresses the pre-college component of the Guided Career Pathways, including career exploration, career planning, and educational planning. Project 2 addresses the college-based components of Guided Career Pathways.  

Through previous grants, the Region has a strong history of providing robust career engagement and exploration activities for middle and high school students and faculty.  In 2017-18, the staff will have offered more than 10,000 students in the region access to CE engagement activities with college and industry guidance. Regional staff partner with DSNs and college faculty to create and implement these activities.

To address these recommendations, in Round 2 the SDIC region will undertake three main activities as part of this pre-college engagement project:

(1) Comprehensive mapping of existing career pathways. 

(2) Coordinated student engagement around CE. 

(3) Professional development for K-14 counselors and faculty.

Each college has its own career services system, which is usually isolated from course content, educational planning and CE leadership. Many community college students do not access career planning and guidance services until they are close to leaving the institution, whether by graduation or by deciding to leave to pursue work. Each college in the region offers some career services which may include career exploration materials and counselors available to students who make their way to the office to seek assistance. Colleges may offer in-person individual and group career counseling. Colleges may also offer a series of job fairs and workshops each semester on career exploration and related topics. In addition, most colleges provide access to online career exploration information and materials on their websites. Many also provide access to online workshops on a range of topics. 

In many majors, students must initiate career planning; it is not always integrated into their CE coursework. Most community college career services require the student to initiate the job search, rather than having career exploration and workplace skills development integrated into the institution's CE courses and ongoing student planning and information systems. Because many students attend more than one institution, students need to be able to transport their career and educational plans among the region's colleges.

Although most colleges also offer links to internship search sites, there is no central site for internships and job placement; employers may be contacted by many different people from across the region looking for placements. Although the career center and CE programs may have leads on some local internship opportunities, the student is often left to find the actual internship on their own. 

In 2017 the SDIC Consortium contracted with WestEd to research and analyze the current status of career pathways and employment readiness in the region. Their research and analysis revealed that while students are persisting in individual courses, they are not completing full pathways within their selected career area. Only 34 percent enroll in aligned course in subsequent terms, and 13 percent remain within the pathway across any of the colleges within the SDIC region. WestEd noted that the populations of San Diego and Imperial Counties and their community college students have pressing needs for robust, differentiated instructional and support services to ensure student persistence and long-term success:
•	Over one-third of the population in the region lives at or near poverty levels.
•	34 percent of the population over 25 (over 750,000 adults) holds a high school diploma or less.
•	46 percent of community college students are over the age of 25; 32 percent are between the ages of 20-24; and 22 percent are age 19 or less. This youngest group appears to be growing.
•	Approximately 38 percent of students in the region are “first generation” college students.
•	Across the ten colleges, 5 to 38 percent of students took one or more credit or noncredit ESL courses.

Approach to address needs. WestEd noted that the “Guided Pathways” approach can help support student success and equitable outcomes — whether certificates, employment, or transfer — by providing structured course sequences, careful intake and planning processes, rich learning opportunities, and robust support services. At the core of this approach is fundamental reconfiguration of the college experience that focuses on student needs and provides “intrusive” or proactive direction that guides students to completion and success. Three regional colleges are currently working with the California Guided Pathways project to develop guided pathways. 

There are four pillars in the guided pathways approach: clarify the path; enter the path; stay on the path; ensure learning. WestEd recommended adding a fifth pillar – employment preparation and transitions – to create Guided Career Pathways.  Rather than working with a subset of students, Guided Pathways is a collegewide undertaking that provides a framework for integrating all of the California-based initiatives. Regional approaches, especially for business engagement processes, can enhance alignment of the Guided Pathways approach with Strong Workforce goals. 

Through their research WestEd identified several key system components as critical for student success in college, employment, further education, and long-term careers. These components are closely aligned with those supported by the Guided Pathways initiative, with additional emphasis on career-related experiences and employment services. The key system components include:

•	Pre-enrollment engagement: activities conducted prior to matriculation with prospective students to facilitate enrollment, and aid in their understanding of the educational options, pathways, and services available.  This component is the focus of Project 1, Pre-College Outreach for Career Education.

•	Matriculation and comprehensive assessment: the process of enrolling in a community college and completing the necessary assessments and plans to pursue a pathway. 

•	Career exploration: a process of learning about career options through workshops, classes, tours, career-related research projects, informational interviews, and job shadows, based on identified interests and goals.

•	Career planning: development of a career plan, which includes a student’s interests, skills, and values, the career options that the student is interested in pursuing, and the educational and work-related experiences that will lead to one or more long-term career goals. 

•	Education planning: development of an education plan, which includes the documentation of the courses needed for a student to complete a specific degree, certificate, or transfer program of study and fulfill their educational goals, both at the community college level and beyond.

•	Pathway participation and career preparation: engagement with the courses and experiences offered in a career pathway. 

•	Applied and work-based learning (WBL): strategies that deepen learning and support career awareness, career exploration, and career preparation through engagement with employers and real work opportunities. 

•	Student supports: the full range of services needed to successfully complete pathways including tutoring, testing for special education, peer study groups, assessment and accessibility supports for students with disabilities, and nonacademic supports for personal needs such as just-in-time housing services, transportation and parking, food and nutrition, child care, financial assistance, and other subsidies. 

•	Employment preparation and transition: activities that prepare students to transition into further education, formal training, and/or the workforce such as resume writing, interview skills, job search services, letters of recommendation, and feedback and coaching opportunities.

Project 1 addresses pre-enrollment engagement.  This project addresses the college-based components of the Guided Career Pathways.  

WestEd made several overarching recommendations about employment readiness and job placement, including:

1.	Recognize career exposure and preparation as a central purpose of the college experience for all students and add a “fifth pillar” to the Guided Pathways model to reflect this view.

2.	Develop a regional approach to career preparation and job placement that builds coherence across all ten colleges for both students and employers.

3.	Integrate career preparation into instruction and student support delivered throughout the students’ college experience, from first entry through transfer and employment, to ensure successful transitions and job placement.

4.	Align institutional and program-level student learning outcomes to reflect a focus on career preparation for all students.

5.	Make career-related services and tools readily accessible to all students.

6.	Expand the scope of the learning environment to include workplaces and communities, positioning work-based learning as integral to career preparation and student success.

7.	Ensure adequate staffing and strengthen processes, supported by technology, to engage all students in comprehensive career planning and career preparation activities, keep them engaged, and monitor their success through employment, as well as to engage employers for advisory services, work-based learning, and job opportunities.

8.	To support students in navigating their college experience from pre-enrollment to employment, provide students a comprehensive and articulated set of the services, resources, and tools —including tools for career planning, career exploration, internships, and job placement.

WestEd provided more specific recommendations for each of the five pillars of the Guided Career Pathways. A copy of their report is available upon request. 

To address these recommendations, in Round 2 the SDIC region will undertake the following activities as part of this Guided Career Pathways project:

1.	Provide staffing to support the development of guided career pathways.

2.	Engage employers in partnerships to develop and implement the fifth pillar of the guided career pathways. 

3.	Pilot implementation of employment readiness and job development processes and tools. 

4.	Provide professional development for participating faculty and staff. 

5.	Research and develop recommendations for creating of a Career Education tutoring program.

"Ohlone College CNET and Multimedia/Graphic Arts departments, in partnership with the Computer Studies Department at Santa Rose Junior College, will offer courses in the operation and maintenance of unmanned aircraft systems (drones) and teach the skills needed for students to take Part 107 Commercial Drone Pilot License. Other departments may subsequently offer course using drones, knowing that students will be licensed and trained in safe and compliant drone operations.","The commercial use of drones is rapidly expanding. Fields as diverse as agriculture, public safety, real estate, hospitality, video production, commercial photography, journalism, and surveying are beginning to heavily utilize drone technology.

"The long-term objective for this project is to increase student enrollment in SDICCCA Career Education (CE) programs by overhauling college websites to increase the number of students successfully enrolling. Steps include (a) develop process for colleges to apply for funds to update their websites; (b) colleges make changes to website to improve student experience and drive enrollment; and (c) develop and implement an evaluation plan to measure effectiveness.  ","In the 2016-17 Strong Workforce Marketing Project, the marketing contractor (Civilian Agency) evaluated the user experience for enrolling in community college on all 10 SDICCCA college websites.  Through this “secret shopper” experience, Civilian determined that the user experience was very poor.  They projected that many students “give up” in the registration process because they find it too difficult to locate the information they need and complete the registration process.  This finding is consistent with other reports from the field.  

CTE enrollments have been in decline throughout the region over the past decade.  However, the gap between job openings and the availability of qualified applicants is expected to increase – with employers of over one million jobs statewide by 2025 unable to find qualified workers to fill their job openings.  The number of students enrolling in CE programs in the region and statewide is not expected to fill that gap.  Strong Workforce Program local funds will provide additional CE training opportunities, but students must be able to access programs, and the current college websites present a barrier to students learning about CE programs and successfully enrolling in them.

The colleges in the San Diego/Imperial region seek to increase enrollments in their CE programs.  However, disorganized and out-of-date websites are a barrier to students registering.  This project will improve student user experiences on websites in all 10 colleges and ensure there is a cohesive, coherent message to all students and potential students in the region.  The State Chancellor's office has retained the services of renowned public relations firm Ogilvie to do an environmental scan and set a path forward to deploy up to $3 million of state funds.  SDICCCA has already committed $3 million (2016-18 Strong Workforce Program funding) to regional CE marketing.  This project aims to ensure that these investments will pay off with an improved user experience for SDICCCA college registration.

Although not properly reflected by lagging LMI data currently all areas within the automotive industry are experience a dramatic need for properly trained and skilled workers.   This includes the general repair side representing dealers, fleets and independent repair shops which include a variety of positions ranging from service technicians, service writers, sales and parts.   In addition the automotive industry is rapidly expanding to include new focus areas ranging from alternative fuels, to automotive machine/manufacturing, to motorsports development.  These areas are above and beyond the normal automotive repair, sales and service side of the industry.

Project Task Areas:
To meet the industry wide need described above and to better serve our students this proposal is divided in to several task areas which will be briefly described below.
Program Outreach: dividing the greater Sacramento area in to regions the participating automotive facility will visit all high schools with automotive or general career education programs.  In addition automotive faculty will facilitate tours of the automotive department on a regular basis.
Dual Enrollment: Working closely with the workforce department, San Juan Unified school district and Natomas district, automotive facility will work towards the implementation of dual enrollment, (college classes on the high school campus) in the 2018 school year.  This includes but is not limed to: supporting new instructors and their facilities, coordinating different school schedules, attending meetings and troubleshooting problems.
Industry Support:  Automotive facility will visit multiple automobile businesses to increase support, build relationships, stay abreast of industry changes and create a network of internship sites for students.
Manufacture Partnerships:  Automotive facility will develop additional partnerships with various automotive manufactures.  This work includes but is not limed to: student database management, curriculum review, participating in meetings & seminars.
Motorsports Education Program & Outreach:  The start of a new and dynamic hands-on training program requires many hours of work and dedication.  To complete this task automotive facility will interview motorsports industry professionals to determine tool and equipment needs, identify appropriate vendors and purchase all needed tools, equipment and supplies.  In addition automotive faculty will work with department staff to properly set up, train and organize all newly purchased equipment.  Lastly to ensure success of this new certificate program faculty will enlist the support of the industry and participate in outreach activities.
General Program Improvement: Automotive facility will interview students to identify program improvement areas of need and then work with department staff to purchase and set up new facility training stations to improve program organization.

Major Project Expenditures:
.2 coordination time for Ben French is requested to implement the motorsports courses and coordinate with industry professionals for motorsport careers.  An additional .2 coordination time is requested for strengthening and building relationships with high schools and to promote new and existing arc automotive classes, support dual enrollment, and encourage the reopening of closed automotive programs.

"The LT career education program prepares students for a variety of positions in the ever-changing, diverse library and information industry. To address these workforce needs the Library Technology program will:
•	 hire an adjunct faculty position to serve as program lead at 8-hours per week
•	purchase equipment to support expanding the curriculum beyond traditional library settings into areas of digitization and document management systems.

","The library technology field shows a 12% increase in demand (LMI 2015-18) and a significant gap between the demand for library technicians and the supply of trained workers (353/26, LMI 2015-18). The median wage of over $25.00 per hour for library technicians underscores the value of this career education path. Demographic data shows the program has strong appeal to women re-entering school and starting new career paths. As stated above, labor market information shows a 12% growth and excess demand over supply of trained library technicians. This includes employers such as schools, public library systems, private sector and government settings.  Beyond the traditional library technician jobs, this project will focus on expanding curriculum and outreach into new information work areas such managing digital resources and document management. Pasadena City College has expanded into this area with a 4-course certificate sequence. See https://pasadena.edu/library/classes-certificates/digitization-skills.php

Most employment in the library industry is part time; however the median wage is $25.00 per hours which adjusted to full time would meet the living wage criteria.  One key population for this certificate program is entry level clerks working at school libraries, some with no training for the job.  With the skills upgrade, clerks are being promoted to library technicians.  ",\n,\n,\n
"The first part of the ROV Project is a faculty-advised and student-led team established to act as an entrepreneurial business to plan, design, build, and demonstrate a remote operating vehicle (ROV) to get experience to eventually build an ROV to compete in spring 2019.  
The second component of the ROV Project is the incorporation of elements of the ROV Project into the curriculum of the ENGTC-166 Manufacturing Processes: Material Machinery II course in the spring 2018 and 2019 semester. ","The Labor Market Information (LMI) 2015-2018 spreadsheet supplied with this document indicated that demand significantly exceeds supply (“demand/supply”) in the program areas that relate most to the ROV Project and curriculum. Areas where demand exceeds supply are “Industrial Technology, General” (<Associate degree 480/23 and Associate degree 58/13) and “Small Business/Entrepreneurship” (<Associate degree 1224/107).
The “% Earn Living Wage” information from this source for the area of “Industrial Technology, General” was not available; however, in the area of “Small Business/Entrepreneurship” the percent of students earning a living wage was 50% (meeting the target of 50%).

machining, small business and law, and marketing. The ROV Project exposes students to engineering technology
(mTECH), electronics, and business disciplines such as finance. It also provides an opportunity for students to develop

"Through Year 1 funding, the Technical Education Division was able to offer counseling targeted for students in all of the division’s programs. This Year 2 proposal is to continue efforts and to improve the services provided to Tech Ed students. One specific goal is to increase the number of comprehensive education plans developed for students. With continued funding, we will develop this program-specific counseling system to become the counseling model for the college.","The Technical Education Division includes Automotive Technology, Design Technology, Electronics Technology, Horticulture, and Welding Technology programs on the main ARC campus, Automotive Collision Technology and Diesel/Clean Diesel Technology at a Mather site, and Pre-Apprenticeship and Electrician Trainee programs at a Twin Rivers site. These are distinct, complex programs with generally strong employer demand. Few (8%) of our students are enrolled full time. 

For many years it has been both the Tech Ed student and faculty perception that there are few general counselors who understand both the value, challenges and critical details of Tech Ed programs. Anecdotal stories abound of students receiving of misleading or incorrect program information from general counselors. To address that information and support gap, the Technical Education faculty and administration felt that having counselors familiar with division programs housed in the area would benefit all students and increase their persistence and success.

For the first round of Strong Workforce programs, the division requested and received funding to introduce and house Tech Ed-specific counselors. This started in the summer of 2017, with one full-time and two adjunct counselors available to meet with students four days and evenings each week in and office in the Tech Ed faculty offices building. The presence of the counselors in the area has been welcomed by students and faculty alike, and is beginning to gain traction. The logistics of rolling out the project, however, has come with challenges. Making appointments is still not a smooth process. The counselors’ outreach to the classes to let students know the services available has been limited. And the initial services were more focused on doing GPSs for students rather than comprehensive education plans. Planned follow up with students has been uneven. But the program has already had an impact and the potential for continued success is huge.

Based on those challenges and observations of the outcomes so far, the Technical Education Division proposes to both continue and simultaneously improve the program. During Spring 2018, the Tech Ed Counselors and the Deans of Counseling and Technical education will assess what has been accomplished through Fall 2017, determine what worked and what could be improved, and then propose and implement modifications for the future that are tied into specific outcomes. The goals will include refining classroom outreach with counselor presentations, focusing on comprehensive education plans, improving the appointment process, and exploring best practices of similar programs throughout the state. The plan is to modify and roll out improved services as soon as possible during the Spring 2018 term, while continuing to analyze and improve services going forward. 

With and improved process and clear goals counselors will be able to increase the number of student contact hours, increase the number of comprehensive education plans, increase the number of classroom presentations, all with the goal of increasing persistence and meeting student academic goals. 

The request is for funding 1.0 FTE adjunct counselors for Spring-Summer 2018, and for a 1.0 FTE full-time counselor for Fall 2018; student help to support the counseling effort, and funding for professional development for the counselors to extend their knowledge and understanding of Technical Education programs as well as Career Education in general and other relevant information, i.e. dual enrollment, etc.

All students in the Technical Education Division will benefit from having in-house, easily-accessible counselors, but disproportionately-impacted students in particular stand to gain the most. In addition to creating comprehensive education plans, Tech Ed counselors will help support students by providing guidance about academic and program issues, financial aid, work-life-school balance, relevant social services, campus student support services including WAC and RAD, internship and employment opportunities, financial aid, scholarships, etc., all of which will improve their persistence and the opportunity for successful completion of their goals.

"Construction of new welding stations to bring our lab capacity from 25 stations to 33. Begin to improve fabrication ability in the lab to create a “simulated workplace” for student interns and students in fabrication classes.","Typically, we have large class sizes due to the high demand for qualified welders in our industry, sometimes up to 40 or more students per class. Our lab was designed for around 25 students, which means that sometimes several students will have to share a workstation, greatly reducing the amount of lab time they can utilize to develop the skills they need. This project would upgrade some of our current workstations and bring up the total amount of workstations from 25 to 33, it would also replace some older equipment with newer equipment that is more up-to-date with technology used in industry as well as more energy efficient. The other goal of this project would be to begin to upgrade the fabrication abilities in the lab to create a “simulated workplace” to further enhance the job skills students learn from our program. We find that students learn the science and techniques of welding, but lack some of the fabrication skills needed to secure and keep the jobs available to them. The workstations would have a table that slides out from the bottom that can be used for fabrication activities for our student interns and fabrication classes and would be a first step toward upgrading these abilities.",\n,\n,\n
"The American Sign Language-English Interpreter Preparation Program is 1 of 2 such programs in northern California.  The program provides a 2-year intensive study of ASL-English interpreting with an integrated series of coursework with a focus on generalist interpreting competencies to prepare students for entry-level positions.  There is a documented lack of interpreters in the Sacramento and surrounding areas. This project will help the college prepare more students for work in the field.","Department Profile: 
The American Sign Language-English Interpreter Preparation Program (ASL-Eng IPP) is one of two such programs in northern California.  The program provides a two-year intensive study of ASL-English interpreting with an integrated series of coursework with a focus on generalist interpreting competencies to prepare students for entry-level positions.  Knowledge of linguistic, cross-cultural and interpretation theories; effective communication in a variety of settings and participants of varying age, gender and ethnicity; knowledge and application of the Code of Professional Conduct; interpersonal and intrapersonal competencies; and preparation for national testing are areas of focus. The program attracts students from all Los Rios institutions, California State University, Sacramento Deaf Studies graduates, Santa Rosa Junior College, Vista College in Berkeley, colleges and universities in Nevada and even students from other parts of the state and country.  There is a documented lack of interpreters in the Sacramento and surrounding areas. 

Additionally, the ARC Deaf Culture and ASL (DC-ASL) Studies Program is intrinsically linked to the ASL-Eng IPP and with each passing year, access to qualified interpreters has worsened for our Deaf community.  In fact, the DC-ASL program is the gateway to the ASL-Eng IPP. Maintaining the quality and the consistency of the ARC Deaf Culture & ASL Studies program is of utmost importance to provide academic coursework based on a Deaf-centered framework that encourages students to embrace an empowered collaboration with Deaf people. New state and federal regulations has increased the demand for qualified interpreters.

Anticipated Growth/Demand: We anticipate growing the program in a variety of areas including the areas of social justice training, additional courses that focus on Deaf Parented Interpreters, interpreting students with knowledge of multiple languages (ex. ASL, English and Spanish), and students who are Deaf who plan on becoming interpreters.  Additionally, there are many specialties within the interpreting field that require additional training and focus including: educational interpreting in the K-12 and post secondary settings, medical interpreting, mental health interpreting, interpreting for Deaf-Blind persons, conference interpreting, interactive interpreting, legal interpreting, etc. 

Additionally, the Health Care Interpreting program and the ASL-Eng IPP have plans to work together to meet the needs of medical interpreting in the area.

Needs in the ASL and IPP Curricula:
A quick review of the Socrates curriculum for both the Deaf Culture and ASL Studies and the ASL-Eng IPP documents the need for a lab for these programs.  All skills based courses require videotaped documentation of ASL skills for language classes and interpreting skills for interpreting classes.  Videotaping is difficult for students to complete outside of a lab due to the technology required for such documentation of skills and the sharing of the video documentation with peers and faculty for review. Additionally, all courses require the completion of additional lab activities that are completed in the lab.  

For interpreting students, all national evaluations are provided via video documentation of the skills that are then submitted to evaluators.  Lab access and availability are critical to the success of students during these evaluations.  One such evaluation, the Educational Interpreting Performance Assessment (EIPA) is required for each student completing the program.  “The EIPA is a tool that evaluates the voice-to-sign and sign-to voice skills of interpreters who work in the elementary through secondary classroom using videotape stimulus materials and a procedure that includes a comprehensive rating system.”  https://www.classroominterpreting.org/EIPA/index.asp 

The (ASL-Eng IPP) currently had numerous DVDs available from the www.classroominterpreting.org website.  A fully functional lab is needed for student videotaping from English to ASL and ASL to English.  Additionally, another national evaluation, the Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf (RID) National Interpreter Certification (NIC), may be taking by students. There are several elements including the NIC Knowledge Exam, NIC Performance Exam, the Certified Deaf Interpreter (CDI) Knowledge Exam and the Certified Deaf Interpreter Performance Exam.  The NIC and CDI Knowledge Exams are computer-based tests.  Students prepare by reading the required materials, available in the lab.  And, online practice tests in preparation for the computer based test.  The NIC and CDI Performance Exams tests the ability to apply the RID Code of Professional Conduct to ethical dilemmas in interpreting situations and real-world interpreting skills appropriate to an interpreter holding national certification.

Local and state evaluations also occur via a video documentation medium including the State Personnel Board Support Services Assistant-Interpreter state evaluation and the ARC DSPS interpreter assessment. 

ASL-Eng IPP students have a particularly full final semester in the program.  In particular, students must earn 108 hours of fieldwork experiences.  Students struggle with having sufficient availability to fully access these experiences, particularly those students who are economically disadvantaged with little financial support.  Provision of payment for the national evaluations and a stipend for the fieldwork experiences can provide the students with the time to focus on these experiences.

Meeting ARC Strategic Goals: 
The proposed lab is aligned with all of the ARC Strategic Goals.  SG1: Student’s First: The goal is to provide an environment where students have access to video documentation followed by self, peer, and teacher review.  Of particular focus are students of color, trilingual students, Deaf students and Deaf parented students.  These are the historically underserved populations in the interpreting field.  SG2: Clear and Effective Pathways: The lab will help in providing a foundation for student success and a career-oriented pathway. SG3: Exemplary Teaching, Learning and Working Environment: Relevant curriculum, state of the art equipment, and academic support contribute to the conditions in honoring the dignity and humanity of all of our students.  SG4: Vibrancy and Resiliency:  The lab promotes this culture of innovation through the latest in technology.

Implementation of Evidence Based Practices
In the field of interpreting, evidence-based practices are the norm.  The Gallaudet University Interpreter Education Series is illustrative of this norm.  In particular, in terms of this project, Interpreter Education in the Digital Age collection outlines the need for digital technology in interpreter education.

Increasing Enrollments, Completions, Transfers, Employment or Wages for Students
Ongoing efforts by the DC-ASL and ASL-Eng IP programs to focus on college to work opportunities for graduates.  This is documented in the ASL-Eng IPP advisory committee meetings wherein advisors have advocated for full lab access for students.

With targeted advertising, we plan to increase awareness about ARC’s Legal Assisting Program in Sacramento and in northern California amongst underrepresented populations. We will use multiple digital marketing strategies to connect with potential students.  Currently, there is only 1 other school in Sacramento that is approved by the American Bar Association (ABA) and students drive from surrounding communities to attend the best school within 100 miles.  

While simultaneously working to increase enrollment, we will provide targeted workshops for students and practicing paralegals with specialized instruction in areas where ARC does not currently offer courses. These workshops will involve law firms and paralegal employers who know exactly what skills are needed from our paralegal graduates. Not only will students gain greater exposure into the legal system, but also potential employers will be making an investment in our students, increasing students’ chances of job placement post graduation.  

After conducting the workshops, we will then be able to make adjust the curriculum to update or add classes that are important to students and to the legal community.  

The legal landscape has changed and is continuing to change dramatically. The traditional law firm model is becoming extinct and paralegals are expected to graduate with a competent skill set that they can use immediately at work. We therefore have to reevaluate and update our training methods to better prepare students for the workforce.  Hosting targeted workshops led by local legal professionals will not only give ARC greater exposure in the community, but also prepare students to complete specific tasks in the practice area covered. After completing the workshop, students can list their participation on their resumes and can tell potential employers about their learning experience. We do not have numbers for employment after the second fiscal quarter, but there has been a slight upward trend in employment from year to year. We need to build upon that upward trend and we can do that by increasing our enrollment and by giving students opportunities to obtain specialized training. 

We will be able to target potential students that are members of underrepresented groups at ARC and in the profession.  Once enrolled, the students will have greater exposure to employers and to specific legal tasks, making them better prepared for the workforce.

","This two-fold project will increase student enrollment in the Legal Assisting program and provide students with targeted training in subject matters that are not currently taught at ARC thereby broadening and enhancing work-based learning opportunities and career exploration and planning. With targeted advertising, we plan to increase awareness about ARC’s Legal Assisting Program in Sacramento and in northern California amongst underrepresented populations. We will use multiple digital marketing strategies to connect with potential students.  Currently, there is only 1 other school in Sacramento that is approved by the American Bar Association (ABA) and students drive from surrounding communities to attend the best school within 100 miles.  

While simultaneously working to increase enrollment, we will provide targeted workshops for students and practicing paralegals with specialized instruction in areas where ARC does not currently offer courses. These workshops will involve law firms and paralegal employers who know exactly what skills are needed from our paralegal graduates. Not only will students gain greater exposure into the legal system, but also potential employers will be making an investment in our students, increasing students’ chances of job placement post graduation. After conducting the workshops, we will then be able to make adjust the curriculum to update or add classes that are important to students and to the legal community.  

The legal landscape has changed and is continuing to change dramatically. The traditional law firm model is becoming extinct and paralegals are expected to graduate with a competent skill set that they can use immediately at work. We therefore have to reevaluate and update our training methods to better prepare students for the workforce. Hosting targeted workshops led by local legal professionals will not only give ARC greater exposure in the community, but also prepare students to complete specific tasks in the practice area covered. After completing the workshop, students can list their participation on their resumes and can tell potential employers about their learning experience. We do not have numbers for employment after the second fiscal quarter, but there has been a slight upward trend in employment from year to year. We need to build upon that upward trend and we can do that by increasing our enrollment and by giving students opportunities to obtain specialized training.

"Through this project, the Horticulture Department will (1) purchase new production equipment to provide the opportunity for students to learn how to use equipment utilized by current industry leaders, (2) update degrees and certificates offered to create sequential class pathways for students to follow through to graduation efficiently, and update the curriculum to match current industry demand; and (3) increase the time of our existing Instructional Aid from .83 FTE to 1.0 FTE.","Production equipment:
Production classes use no current equipment such as automatic seeders, potting machines, hydroponics etc.  The result is that they do not get experience on the most current equipment used in the industry and end up learning on the job. By purchasing, using and incorporating these machines and systems into the curriculum students will be prepared to work in the industry and move into management positions faster. 

Irrigation upgrades:
The existing irrigation system is antiquated from and equipment standpoint and aging.  It is constantly causing leaks and down time.  There is no current technology in use and provides no benefit to students other than to teach them how to repair a system. The proposed project would replace the existing system utilizing the most current technologies in the irrigation industry.  Smart controllers, central control systems, flow sensors, soil moisture sensors and the latest technologies in drip systems would be installed.  This will allow the horticulture department to save time and water.  It will also allow students to learn to use systems that are current in the industry on large and small scale projects alike.  Students with this knowledge are extremely hirable and in high demand by Landscape Management Companies. 

Instructional Assistant:
The Instructional Aid is an integral part of our program.  The aid is responsible for preparing class labs, coordinating the facility operations and maintenance.  The horticulture facilities require ongoing maintenance and the product used in labs requires constant attention given that they are living materials. Without a full time Instructional Aid the class labs suffer and the potential for lost product is very high.  With the current Instructional Aid at .83 FTE she is unable to take time off (normal holidays only partially paid for etc) which is causing her to become dissatisfied with the position. Without this aid the department will not be able to function. By bringing the Instructional Aid to full time her job satisfaction will be regulated and she will be able to put the time in that the job demands. ",\n,\n,\n

This project is oriented around all of the college’s new strategic goals and focuses on confronting barriers to entry and success through and beyond our program. ","The Natural Resources department at ARC is unique among community colleges in the region in providing innovative programs that develop knowledge and skills of students entering the dynamic field of environmental science (including ecology, conservation, management, and policy), a discipline which is increasingly relevant and for which an undersupply of workers is indicated (see LMI data). This project is oriented around all of the college’s new strategic goals and focuses on confronting barriers to entry and success through and beyond our program. 
  
This project aims to:
•	Increase enrollment from area high schools
•	Explore viability of offering our core introductory course, NATR 300, in area high schools 
•	Increase enrollment, active participation, learning, and success (in form of persistence and completion of goals) of special populations of students, including economically-disadvantaged students, students of color and ethnic minorities generally, disabled students, students with limited English proficiency, military veterans, first in family to college, etc.
•	Increase awareness about our program on ARC campus, sister colleges, and in the greater Sacramento region 
•	Enhance training of students towards cutting-edge theory and practice in the discipline
•	Enhance pathways to employment for current students and graduates
•	Enhance pathways to transfer

The Natural Resources programs in Environmental Conservation are based on strong, hands-on and “heads-on” curricula, which we constantly work to align with emerging issues as well as developing technologies/methodologies and expanding understanding of natural systems.  Our students prepare for a variety of employment and transfer opportunities related to environmental policy, forestry, evolution and ecology, agriculture, wildlife and fisheries conservation and management, environmental restoration, among others. However, our program remains quite small and largely unknown, and suffers from low enrollment by special populations (as described above). Priorities for Natural Resources for the 2017-2018 year focus strongly on enrollment management and outreach; increased student persistence and program completions; and enhanced internship, employment, and transfer placements. To address these, specific goals of the project include:

•	Area high school visits—(1) they come to us, e.g., “Exploring Natural Resources” events at ARC; (2) we visit Environmental Science (and related) classes with interactive sessions, demonstrations, etc., including with current ARC students and graduates
•	Community outreach—including participation in regional events such as youth symposia (e.g., BLM Youth Summit event), area STEM fair, Creek Week, Earth Day, etc.
•	College outreach—including participation in campus events such as Welcome Day, Career Fairs, Steps to Success, etc.
•	Development of NATR 300 course for area high school(s) to be taught by one of our adjuncts; coordination with high school districts and campus faculty and administrators
•	Targeted outreach to and engagement with special populations of students (see above) via collaboration with on-campus and off-campus organizations (Puente, Umoja-Sakhu, Mexican-American student organizations, Mascot, DSPS, ESL services, Veterans services, etc.), as well as specific efforts and acquisition of equipment and instructional materials to make learning more effective for these students in our program
•	Development of innovative, state-of-the-art field laboratory activities and classroom projects, exercises, and assessments (involves research, design, ordering, testing, preparation, set-up, installation/execution, evaluation)
•	Enhancement of peer and faculty mentoring of students in our program, especially as it involves special populations (as mentees and peer mentors), including implementation of regular student surveys to better understand barriers, interests, etc. and to gain valuable feedback on our efforts.
•	Enhancement of internship, employment, and transfer institution opportunities, including: (1) expanding communication efforts with 4-year institutions about major requirements, articulation, etc.; (2) workshops for students about 4-year programs in this discipline and best ways to align student interest, background, and requirements/content of transfer institution; (3) workshops for students run by industry experts, potential employers and potential internship supervisors
•	Enrollment management including production of informational videos, photography, and printed materials; enhanced interaction with ARC counselors, campus public information officer, newspaper, etc.
•	Keeping students current—guest speakers on cutting-edge research and natural resources management issues; taking students to conferences in the region

Traditionally underserved populations are exactly the groups we most want to reach with this project. Investment in activities involving outreach, interactive workshops (where students can receive enhanced training and interaction), internships through our NATR 498 course (where students participate in direct work experiences in the field), and peer and faculty mentoring will be designed to target and include disproportionately impacted students.",\n,\n,\n
"The overall goal of this project is to facilitate a smooth transition and experience to students within our feeder school districts. This program will support high school students currently enrolled in an articulation and or dual enrollment program. We plan to align existing services and create a framework that will be focused towards specific outreach targeted to our CTE pathways. ","Currently there is a need for outreach specific to career technical education. The primary components of this project are as follows: 
•	Focused outreach
•	Recruitment
•	Intentional Commination 
•	High School Registration
•	Transition Support
•	Peer Mentorship 
•	Certificate Preparation 

The needs identified above are a result of observation and hands–on experience. The CTE Transitions Grant Currently does not support ALL CTE programs, only those that are articulated with a high school. This is extremely limiting because such efforts needed to support ARC campus CTE programs are not all benefiting from the grant through Outreach, recruitment transition support and peer mentorship.

This investment will support disproportionately impacted students by creating more awareness in parts of the community that we haven’t communicated with as of yet.  We are starting to create awareness of the growing demand for diesel technicians and collision repair technicians through the local high schools.  Students of our programs help spread the word, but we also need to work in conjunction with our local industry in building stronger pathways and job opportunities for our students that are or will be entering the workforce.

Through various articles and talking to our industry partners we find that there is a major need for qualified technicians.  We instruct and train students through the classroom and lab projects actual hands on experiences that they use in the workforce.  The coordinator will continue to work with staff and assist in bringing more industry to our programs to build additional pathways for our students to thrive and build connections with.

Along with building connections, the coordinator will continue to keep both programs on the cutting edge of new technology that we will impart to our students.   By staying in contact with our industry partners, it also allows for knowledge of updated training that our instructors should be taking so that they can pass that knowledge where applicable to the students.

The Veterans’ Entrepreneurship Program (VEP) will address the needs of the local labor market by increasing the number of certificates attained in Small Business Management and Entrepreneurship, as well as the number of Associate Degrees in Business. Those certificates and associate degrees are also available to students in general and beyond just the Veterans population. The entrepreneurial ventures started by Veterans will likely employ both Veterans and other students in general, and help address the labor market demand/supply imbalance in the local economy.

"This is a continuation of a Year 1 SWP Local Share project.  The ARC Health and Education Division—specifically the nursing, respiratory care, emergency medical technician/paramedic programs—propose the hiring of a 12-month, 40-hour per week instructional assistant to provide support to faculty and students in the simulation lab (IA). The goal of the project is to improve on time completion rates in the identified programs and to provide ‘hands-on’ simulation experiences for the students.","The simulation lab provides the opportunity for students to apply knowledge and skills in a low risk, yet high-reality environment. Additionally, the IA will work with the three programs to provide simulations to enhance collaborative health team synergy. This educational environment promotes improved theory test scores and achievement of objectives in the clinical setting. 

Job Description Duties for Simulation Lab Instructional Assistant include, but are not limited to:
•	Lab Maintenance (equipment): assure that equipment is fully functional; maintain maintenance records for equipment as needed; maintain equipment as needed or coordinate with appropriate maintenance personnel if it is beyond IA scope; act as point person for troubleshooting and problem solving in the following areas: simulators, air  compressor, gasses
•	Lab Maintenance (usage): create, and modify as needed, policies relating to the use of the lab (not medical policies) and refer to supervising dean; manage print requests as needed to provide faculty and students with appropriate paper resources that are supportive to the scenarios or lab maintenance; fill out work order requests, to be approved by supervising dean, for jobs beyond the scope of the IA; manage appointment bookings for simulation lab usage; manage teaching resources for instructor check-out; maintain organizational files for several aspects of the simulation lab; oversee students & track timing/attendance for educational endeavors including: viewing videos, reviewing other educational materials, prepping for an upcoming scenario
•	Faculty Assistance: assist faculty in creation of scenario related documents, such as chart documents and forms; collaborate with faculty in planning scenario runs to promote clear understanding of expectations and provide support to faculty in the following manner: prepare patient charts (with faculty support as needed); set up simulators or provide written instruction and supplies to do so if IA will not be present day of simulation; make sure appropriate supplies are available for student use (as well as simulator set up); be available to troubleshoot as needed; be available to run the computer portion of scenarios, in conjunction with faculty presence, if needed; clean up after scenario run.
•	Inventory: keep supplies stocked and available for scheduled Scenario use; order supplies as needed; maintain inventory management and records.

There are several benefits to adding more and better simulation experiences for Allied Health programs:

1.	Simulation provides students a safe learning environment in which to practice
2.	Simulation exposes students to high-risk situations that they would not be privy to in a hospital.
3.	Recently hospital partners are limiting the number of students they will take on each unit in a hospital. With fewer clinical sites to send students, we need a more robust simulation experience on campus to ensure students meet clinical objectives.
4.	In-hospital Clinical hours, as required by our accrediting agencies, may be reduced, more hours will be needed for the Simulation experiences. 

The simulation lab provides the opportunity for students to apply knowledge and skills in a low risk, yet high-reality environment. The IA will work with the three programs to provide collaborate simulations to enhance collaborative health team synergy. This educational environment promotes improved theory test scores and achievement of objectives in the clinical setting for all students, and it provides opportunities for students who need additional assistance to practice their skills.

The professional development series will consist of cutting-edge workshops for various strands of the field such TK Teachers, preschool teachers, Family Childcare providers, pre-service teachers and any caregivers who serve infants, children and their families. Participants will learn about current research and best practices","The TEPD Series will provide learning opportunities to support current students as they grow personally and professionally here at MSJC. The primary purpose is to support educational development in both formal (for credit coursework) and informal (professional growth- not for credit) learning environments. Current students will attend the workshops with community members and new potential students.  The TEPD learning community will increase retention and success by providing the support of a non- threatening learning community designed to build cohesion of the early learning community and foster a student's foundational skills that will be used to complete either for credit or not for credit coursework. According to National Survey on Student Engagement (NSSE), a high impact practice in education is learning communities. The research suggests students in learning communities form stronger relationships with faculty and other students but that they engage more deeply in the content. They, therefore, are more likely to pass their courses, persist due to the increasing support and graduate with a credential. There are many models of learning communities and this uses an informal format to support students who may be in for credit and not for credit learning environments.

"The MAD department will expand and improve the 2017-2018 SWP, Projection Mapping and Motion Design for Multimedia project by the creating a sequence of at least 2 classes and a one certificate focused on Motion Capture. Motion Capture is the technology used in film production to capture the live performance of human actors and map their facial and body movements onto virtual synthetic actors. ","Examples of this MAD Motion Capture+Projection Mapping & Motion Design technology can be found in the completely synthetic actor Gollum in the LORD OF THE RINGS films whose facial and body performance were captured from the actor Andy Serkis and mapped onto the 3D model of Gollum, also Brad Pitt's performance in THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMEN BUTTON or various characters found in the HBO series WEST WORLD.  

Another business sector heavily invested in motion capture technology is the computer game industry. Nearly all computer games found on computers, TV set top boxes, tablets and cellphones use motion capture technology to bring life to the characters and creatures that populate the virtual worlds that make up computer games. The employment opportunities for students who master motion capture technology is limitless. Orange County game companies, Blizzard Entertainment, Carbine Studios, Amazon Game Studios, Atlus, Bad Juju, Coresoft, Obsidian Entertainment, are just a few of the hundreds of computer game companies in Southern California using motion capture technology in their games. The new program of study will be focused on training students for the employment opportunities available in the film, television and entertainment industries. The new program will teach the aesthetics of design, 
technical, and software skills required to capture human movements and apply them to 3D software models through motion capture technology. The addition of the Motion Capture technology would increase the quality of this CTE program, create a new career pathway, a new certificate and increase the quantity of course offerings, certificates and 
career pathways. The creation of the Motion Capture curriculum would increase student participation in the MAD department and increase student enrollment by 200%. 
The addition of the Motion Capture courses would increase the number of quality career technical education courses, programs and pathways, which will lead to improved workforce outcomes. This program does not require a specific room or stationary lab. We will use of a mobile lab where hardware and software will be available to students and faculty to use in any space on campus. The tools used in the instruction and production of design work will be housed in a mobile cart that can be deployed to any room where a class can meet. The MAD department's 2017-2018 SWP grant has partially funded the purchase of this mobile computer cart. We currently have funds to purchase the cart and 15 laptops. We would like to purchase an additional 10 laptops to bring the total to 25 laptops. Given the shortage of space in the Fine Arts building this new mobile lab will promote an in increase in enrollments due to the 
fact the classes associated with the program may be scheduled anywhere on campus due to the mobility of the equipment cart. The creation of this new program of study will increase the number of students who earn a certificate by providing a new area of study that is unique, rapidly growing and in great demand in the entertainment industries. Students and faculty will work with businesses in the community and other departments on campus to put these new skills into practice and demonstrate the value of motion capture technology beyond the uses found in the entertainment industry. The interaction between these businesses and the program will build relationships, which will lead to internships and increased employment in the field. The 
Media Arts Design Department will partner with local companies located in Cypress and Orange County such as Premier Displays, Presentation Media Inc., Code 4 Media Group, Show Ready, the OC Fair, Blizzard Entertainment, Carbine Studios, Amazon Game Studios, Atlus, Bad Juju, Coresoft, Obsidian Entertainment. This new program of study will increase median earnings among students enrolled in the program by providing a skills and knowledge in emerging fields. Students who successfully complete the certificate will be positioned to apply for entry-level jobs that provide a high rate of income. The industry provides both union jobs and non-union jobs. The highest level of union jobs for workers in this field will be found in the motion picture and television industries where high wages, health benefits and pensions are the norm. This provides a valuable opportunity for workers in a world where union jobs are becoming more and more rare. 

In Los Angeles and Orange Counties, employment for multimedia and animation professionals is expected to increase by 14 between 2014 and 2024 and 8 nationwide by 2026. There were 73,700 jobs for multimedia and animation professionals in 2016. This number is expected to increase to 79,900 by 2026. The annual openings represent total separations plus job growth. he median annual wage for multimedia artists and animators was $65)00 in May 2016. The median wage is the wage at which half the workers in an occupation earned more than that amount and half earned less. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $38,520, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $115,960.

"The Fitness and Recreation Career Pathways and Innovation Project proposes to improve two CTE certificates, Aquatics Specialist and Athletic Coach, and add new courses and two new certificates, Fitness Specialist and Recreation Assistant, to support CTE students seeking careers in the above fields. ","The new courses and certificates are being developed in collaboration with, and in response to, local high school demands for such training and regional industry trends that are driving changes in the fitness industry. Additionally, transfer degrees and AA degree will include new courses as well, further increasing enrollments in new courses and completion rates. As of 2014-15, enrollments in our CTE programs were limited.  With the expansion of the programs and new class offerings, enrollments will increase.

Additional data from Strong Workforce Program Metrics CalPassPlus show that other campuses offered Fitness Trainer TOP (083520) coded classes and program/s with high success.  MiraCosta College reported 720 course enrollments and 66 certificates in 2016-17. The leading region in Fitness Trainer classes and program delivery was San Diego-Imperial, which posted 1,737 enrollments and 97 certificates. Overall course enrollments statewide have increased by 416 seats from 5,671 to 6,087 between 2015-16 and 2016-17. Interestingly, there were only statewide data available for Recreation Assistant (083610) with enrollments of 1,011 and 2 certificates awarded in 2016-17; no programs are currently active in the LA/OC area, suggesting that this particular program has yet to achieve visibility.  The need for above proposed programs is clearly supported by employment projections and workforce outcome data.

This project will lead to successful workforce outcomes by meeting the market demand as well as increasing earnings of the CTE students. According to the Worldwide Survey of Fitness Trends for 2018 (ACSM, 2017), Educated, certified, experienced fitness professionals trend ranked #6 and Personal Training trend ranked #8.  Employment of fitness trainers and instructors is projected to grow 10 percent from 2016 to 2026, faster than the average for all occupations. Employment of recreation workers is projected to grow 9 percent during the same time period (Bureau of Labor and Statistics). 

Further, this project will have strong emphasis on development of relevant industry partnerships and work-based learning opportunities as stated in the Cypress College Educational Master Plan. We will sustain and develop new partnerships with professional partners and develop internship opportunities. 

By the end of project completion, there will be an increase in quantity and quality of our programs and the number of educational opportunities for CTE students at Cypress College. With the addition of new courses and new certificates, the enrollments rates will increase.  We will provide hands-on experience for our CTE students that will meet or exceed industry standards. This will not only increase the number of CTE students in our classes but also students’ completion of certificates and degrees.  The CTE students, who have earned a certificate or met other educational goals, are more likely to secure employment upon program completion. Collaborative and individual efforts are paramount to project completion.  The success of the project is contingent on curriculum development, access to specialized equipment, professional development, and outreach. 

As businesses, government, and insurance organizations continue to recognize the benefits of health and fitness programs for their employees, incentives to join gyms or other types of health clubs are expected to increase the need for fitness trainers and instructors. As more emphasis is placed on the importance of lifelong well-being, more recreation workers will be needed to work with children and adults of all ages in a variety of settings.  Data from the Bureau of Labor and Statistics (Table 3) show the job outlook for employments related to our CTE certificates with a range of projected growth between 6-21% in 2014-24. It is important to note that California ranks 1st in the employment level of Fitness Instructors and Recreation Workers occupations. ",\n,\n,\n

"This project will provide up-to-date training in the Diesel Technology field. The hardware that is on the older engines is starting to fail and there are no replacement components for them. Local diesel repair shops are already using the equipment that we are trying to obtain in this proposal. As one of the only schools in southern CA to provide training for heavy-duty diesel, it is vital our college stays on the cutting edge of training the technicians that arrive at our school for training. ","The advisory committee and industry representatives have discussed new engine and new technologies as required by state regulations. The current equipment in the diesel shop needs upgraded engines with new fuel injection equipment for the engines to be compliant with such regulations and engine equipment established last year in 2017. The engines have older emission and fuel injection packages that are being phased out of the diesel engines. The engines with their emissions and fuel injection systems being used in the diesel lab are as old as the model year 1992. One engine we used to have that became obsolete for repair was a Detroit engine from 1988. These have been useful in hardware and component lab activities, but the new engines starting in 2017 have components that the older ones do not have. The engines and corresponding systems are used in more than two-thirds of the diesel courses taught within the program. The current engines are turn-key style engines, which means we turn the key and are meant for dynamic training. More than half of the existing ones were hand built units and are starting to break down and need components that no longer can be purchased. By obtaining new equipment, we will be able to update our program with new equipment. New and updated equipment will be able to serve all students including non-traditional and economically disadvantaged. The proposal will address the students becoming trained in several of the new technologies that have been adopted for the year 2017. Santa Ana College is one of the very few colleges training students in the diesel industry occupations. Having the most up-to-date engines, the powertrain that drives the vehicles is crucial to student occupation preparedness. The diesel engine is found in the majority of any commercial transportation vehicle, the program would improve its training by having up-to-date engines and the equipment systems that will be integrated into the units themselves. Such equipment comes in different forms and brands of engines. The engines that are major contributors to the vehicle brands are Caterpillar, Cummins, Detroit, and International. The engines would also be used in the coursework for automotive since there is a diesel course cross-listed with the Automotive program. The purchase of modern diesel technology equipment will assist students to obtain higher skills in the diesel technology program and that will help our students complete certificates at a higher rate.

UAV Project review by LAEDC Southern California Aerospace Council (SCAC) subgroup to link technical skills needed by students for Aerospace Industry within Los Angeles Basin.  Note:  UAV Regional is model after Project Title “Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Training Project” Funding Source: City of Los Angeles Economic and Workforce Development Department.

Drones, known as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), are simply aircrafts without a human pilot. Their flight can be controlled either by a pilot on the ground who operates the aircraft remotely or autonomously by an on-board computer or robot.  According to a 2013 report by the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International (a group representing 7,500 individual members and 600 corporations), FAA approval of commercial drones could lead to the creation of 70,000 new U.S. jobs within the next three years, which is an attainment of an economic impact valued at $82 billion by 2025 and the creation of 100,000 new U.S. jobs by 2025. (http://www.auvsi.org/blogs/auvsi-membership/2015/11/23/energyandcommerce)  

The commercial and military impact UAV’s will have in the coming years is very significant. Thus, it is almost a certainty that the need for workers with the ability to build, pilot and monitor these drones is going to be significant. Namely, the U.S. budget for drone warfare has increased from $667 million in 2002 to more than $3.9 billion, according to the Congressional Research Service. Additionally, the number of drones in military service has increased from 167 to nearly 7,500 (AUVSI, http://www.auvsi.org/). 

Many commercial vehicles are now being equipped with robotic mechanisms that help monitor and control a range of components. From communication to stopping the vehicle, technology has evolved enough to bring unmanned vehicles to the level of safe, efficient and effective transportation of goods and products. It is this innovative blend of technology and transportation that will open the door for many creative strategies. From a practical perspective, the use of unmanned vehicles can save time, effort, and energy simply by maximizing the use of human beings that traditionally exert manual efforts for ground-level tasks.

"The EMS program increased its FTES significantly through the addition of a third paramedic cohort. The workload for supporting the FTES growth has necessitated the addition of a Senior Instructional Assistant to coordinate the specialty lab and medical equipment utilized within the paramedic and all other EMS programs. This project will also provide support to the American Heart Training Center located within the EMS Program and support the simulation program by purchasing isimulate equipment.","The additional cohort program concept was initially conceived through our advisory committee meeting feedback. This was a 'gap analysis' driven and noted that a significant number of potential paramedic students were being forced to attend an outside of county or state paramedic program, simply due to the structure of the course meeting days and times. The California job availability for EMS personnel are at a significant high and the trend is expected to continue for the next decade with a projected +24% growth in the state and nation for jobs. The American Heart Training Center contributes to job readiness by providing coursework that allows the student/graduate the ability to achieve and maintain additional certifications necessary for employment upon successful completion of their individual coursework. This necessitates that we have clearly identified, properly licensed and certified, educated individuals to maintain the AHA Training Center Status. Additional one-time equipment purchasing is necessary to complete the AHA equipment cache.",\n,\n,\n
"This proposal is to develop and deliver a Nursing Continuing Education course focusing on RN graduates who have been unable to find employment in the acute care setting and refresher RNs. There are recent RN graduates in OC who have not been successful in obtaining a RN position within one year of graduation.This leads to degradation of their knowledge and psychomotor skills. Additionally, there are RNs who have been out of the workforce for years and do not have recent/updated knowledge.","The purpose of the course is to bring together the registered nurses who have been unable to find employment in the nursing field because of lack of experience, outdated skills and knowledge, and/or mandated review by the Board of Registered Nursing disciplinary board. The funding will be used to create a course, purchase supplies and equipment, and provide training to faculty regarding simulation. The course will provide a more focused curriculum directed at the entry level Medical/Surgical employment positions available to the students upon completion of the course. Currently, the only course available to the students is a 1/2 (0.5) unit self-directed skills lab course, that has no aspect of theory or simulation attached to it. Instructional supplies and simulators will be purchased for use by the students. Faculty will be trained in simulation and debriefing techniques and a simulation technician will be hired to assist the faculty during simulations. 


Registered nurses have the highest projected job openings within the health care setting for practitioners and technical occupations. Those open positions will come from hospitals, ambulatory and residential care. There is concern of how future health reform, the aging healthcare workforce, as well as the aging population at large will impact the workforce supply moving forward. 

Registered nurses that are not working in the acute care, ambulatory, and residential care setting either have stepped out of nursing for a period of time, or have been unsuccessful in finding employment because they are recent graduates. Hospital, ambulatory and residential care facilities have asked community colleges to integrate communication, interpersonal skills, critical thinking, and organizational skills into existing training. The design of the course will allow them to develop and practice these skills and update their resumes in the field of nursing to make them more marketable candidates and assist them in finding employment.

"Fortify career pathways from K12 through degree/certificate programs into work-based learning/jobs. Provide faculty Navigator(s)/Liaison(s) for: Targeted representation/recruitment in area schools; Support enrollment, success, & completion; Guest lectures, workplace tours, work-based learning; Cultivate industry partners for internships/career entry assist; Events/publicity. Outcomes include increased enrollment/completion, student preparation for emerging workforce and creation of partnerships.","This project addresses a multitude of needs. For the purposes of this rationale we will identify five major categories of need and summarize how this project will address them.
 
For clarity we are calling this position(s) Pathway Navigator and/or Liaison. The faculty will be expected to do both. Generally, a Navigator will shepherd students through the program. Responsibilities may include assisting with enrollment, expediting completion paperwork, and guiding students through challenges while at ELAC. A Liaison will provide a bridge to-and-from the program. Responsibilities may include working with feeder programs from K-12 schools, cultivating industry partnerships, and creating internships and job opportunities with potential employers.
 
1) Recruitment
 
We are located in the entertainment capital of the world. Students in the K-12 schools in our service area, however, do not understand the possibilities that these industries offer them for creative expression and financial security. Many of their schools do not have professional art, theater, or media programs.
 
We will address this need by having an experienced media professional represent and recruit for our program at targeted area high schools. They will present our students’ work and success stories along with true-to-the-industry job descriptions and expectations. The possibilities of our program will be brought to pre-college students in a realistic and meaningful way. These liaisons will develop relationships with like-minded teachers, administrators, and counselors at these schools to facilitate and perpetuate this process. They will also create media presentations that can represent our program.
 
These approaches will be useful throughout the school year, but particularly important as the students become eligible to co-enroll in our classes and/or prepare for graduation.
 
 
2) Student Success
 
Well over 1000 students pass through our program every school year. Almost all of them show a potential in the media arts field, but very few of them go on to complete a certificate or degree which could lead to a meaningful and financially stable career. Our students are frustrated by many life issues including distractions at home, challenges of academic logistics, a lack of proper college-level preparation, and for many being the first in their family to attend college.
 
Our program currently has no specific mechanism for supporting our students. This project will allow us to offer easily accessible consistent support from someone who has worked in their area of interest, understands the curriculum and our school, and can help them stay on the pathway to academic and professional success. The Navigator/Liaison will also help students through the application process for certificates and/or degrees and can expedite the paperwork from the administrative side. Unlike other support modalities, this faculty member will be aggressively proactive in visiting classrooms, getting information from other faculty, targeting students, and tracking students after exiting. They will be available in the department itself.
 
3) Employment Success  
 
Even when our students attain a professional level of skill and complete our program, many students still lack the soft skills and confidence needed to gain employment. Even though soft skills are a major learning outcome of our CTE classes, we have a persistent idiosyncratic problem. Shy, socially awkward, autistic spectrum students and students with similar challenges are often not able to use the kind of coaching that occurs in a traditional class in this respect.
 
All of our students could benefit from individual coaching, mock interviews, and portfolio/resume reviews that will be offered by our faculty Navigators.
 
In addition to more individualized employment preparation, our Navigator/Liaisons will be able to leverage their industry contacts to create opportunities such as job shadowing, site visits, and guest lectures that would also increase students’ preparation for gainful employment and success.
 
 
4) Untapped Partnership with the Theater Arts Department
 
Our program has many areas that significantly overlap with that of the Technical Theater Program. This includes, but is not limited to employers that potentially would hire students from both programs, high schools and magnet programs that cover both topics, a pool of potential students who are interested in professional art, craft, storytelling and self-expression, an employment system that is heavily tilted towards freelance, entertainment industry events etc.
 
Currently, however, we have no system in place for capitalizing on these commonalities. This proposal will create a strategic partnership by combining efforts in the liaison part of these faculty positions. For instance, our liaison and the liaison from the theater department could make presentations together at high schools. Because media artists and technical theater artists consistently work together, they have an understanding and appreciation for each other’s professions. Once they have seen and participated in presentations together they will eventually be able to give basic presentations for both programs. This will effectively double the reach of our high school recruitment.
 
In industry/employment terms most guest lectures and site visits will be of interest to the students of both disciplines. Many professional partners will have job openings in both categories. Employers visiting the college to tour one department would likely be equally interested in seeing the other. Our liaisons will facilitate this.
 
Photography students could document stagecraft for technical theater students’ portfolios. Technical theater students could provide art direction, make up, wardrobe styling and set design for photography students. This project will connect these students.
 
5) Untapped Industry Partnerships
 
If you ask anyone in a position to hire in the Media/Entertainment Industry, they will likely tell you about the gap between what employers need and what the graduates of most schools offer. Having a dedicated liaison can bring consistent communication with our industry partners can help us to close this gap for our students. This can be done in many ways including bringing back specific feedback on our programs and our student portfolios. Also, involving employment decision-makers with the work and education, especially for students who are close to completion, has a powerful effect in both directions. This is especially true in the case of students who might not present well in an interview situation. Employers would have the chance to get to know our students in a different context.
 
 
6) Social Media Opportunities
 
Social media, especially Instagram, offers tremendous opportunity for promoting our department, our students, and our classes. At the same time it is a powerful tool to create a sense of pride and community. Even though we have the content, we lack the ability to consistently and coherently participate on these platforms.
 
Our Navigator/Liaisons will be able to coordinate our social media efforts and increase our new media participation. This can also be leveraged to attract employers, publicize events, increase enrollment, and remind students of important logistical deadlines.

"The purpose of this proposal is to support our “Projects In Common Biomanufacturing” grant project to supply local HS teachers with supplies and reagents for their biotech classes made by our SAC Biotech students to increase student awareness of biotechnology,to provide HS teachers with high quality biotech supplies and reagents manufactured by SAC Biotech students, to provide SAC Biotech students with real work based learning experience,to improve employment path from HS to SAC to biotech jobs.","Biotechnology is a field with job opportunities throughout Orange County.  Recruiting students to this field has been a struggle.  Students are scared of the term “Biotechnology”.  They find it intimidating and cannot picture themselves doing it.  

We believe a possible solution is to recruit students at a younger age by getting them to perform more advanced hands-on biotechnology experiments in high school.  One of the obstacles to this has been that high school teachers do not have access to the costly reagents necessary to run these experiments.  

Our solution, is SAC Biotech student-made reagents and supplies for high school teachers.  We believe that this will provide high school teachers access to supplies and reagents so that they can work with their students on more exciting problems while giving SAC Biotech students the hands-on experience of working in a biomanufacturing facility make actual products.  Instead of sitting in a high school class and listening to a scientific principle, the students can be engaged by actually trying out that technique for themselves.  We believe that more students would become excited by science by doing it themselves rather than just hearing about it. 

In addition, this project provides our SAC Biotech students practical experience manufacturing products, meeting deadline, quality inspecting materials, planning a process from start to finish, trouble-shooting on the fly and communicating with co-workers and customers.  They will have a chance to practice laboratory skills and soft-skills while they manufacture these products.  This will better prepared them to use these skills in internships in local biotechnology companies.   

We are utilizing several grants to help with this project.  The Projects in Common grant will be providing transportation and money for supplies.  The SAC Tech Career Pathways Trust grant is our primary pathway development grant with SAUSD.  Through this grant we are working out dual enrollment pathways as well as articulation agreements.  We have utilized a National Science Foundation Advanced Technology Education grant for equipment funding.  And the SWP Regional grant is paying for marketing, professional development, industry outreach and program coordination.  

In this grant, we are requesting a full-time storekeeper for Biotech to help coordinate media and reagent prep, track inventory, order supplies and materials, and to oversee equipment maintenance and operation equipment.  In addition, this individual would be responsible for overseeing orders placed by the high school, coordinate transportation for the deliveries and returns and inspect equipment loaned to the high schools.

With this grant we hope to increase student awareness of biotechnology by providing high school teachers with high quality biotech supplies and reagents manufactured by SAC Biotech students.  And to provide SAC Biotech students with a real work based learning experience which will improve our employment pathway from high school to SAC to biotech jobs.

The overall goal of this project is to develop and implement a Pathway to Advancement of Cybersecurity Education (PACE) from MS all the way to 4-year College with multiple
opportunities for employment exit points.","This project is part of the growing / emerging ICT/DM career pathway selected for funding by the LAOC Regional Consortium on the basis of its growing employment demand and gap. Employers report that they are unable to keep up with the demand for well-trained ICT employees specializing in cyber-security. LMI and the gap analysis is currently being performed by the LAOC Center of Excellence.

"For every client that enters a substance abuse treatment center, a thorough assessment must be conducted.  This proposed project will train 30 students a semester to conduct the assessments that are used throughout Los Angeles County. Due to the fact that properly conducted and input assessments are vital to the financial stability of treatment centers, the skilled assessor is a desirable employee.  This proposed project will train  ELAC students to work as assessors.","When a client enters into a substance abuse treatment center, an assessment must be conducted.  The thoroughness and accuracy of the assessment determines the type of treatment the client receives, as well as the rate of financial reimbursement from the state to the treatment center. The accuracy of the assessment is also evaluated when a treatment center is audited, with any errors in the assessment creating a decrease in funding.  Therefore, a well-conducted assessment can mean improved treatment for the patient, and improved funding for the treatment center.

In the last two years the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) has implemented an assessment tool with a criteria for treatment.  In order to receive state funding, this elaborate assessment must be completed for every client. Each assessment takes at least one hour, but most often up to three hours to complete. There have been trainings conducted throughout the county on how to complete the assessments; however based on information from our internship supervisors, many treatment center employees struggle with the accurate completion of this assessment.  During advisory meetings and clinical internship site visits, supervisors have indicated the need for our students to be trained in the ASAM assessment toll, as well as a variety of assessment tools.  The students training in the assessment measures would greatly assist the treatment centers in serving more clients, and in collecting state funds. The assessment measures are used in almost every treatment center in the county.

Currently, when the students in the Addiction Studies Program are in their internship, they are not given individualized training on the assessment measures.  Instead, they are asked to ""shadow"" a counselor, and through this experience are to glean the proper way to conduct an assessment.  Therefore, their proficiency in assessing substance abuse varies based on their individual supervisor. When seeking employment some may feel confident to put on their resumes that they are ASAM trained, while others do not. Since almost all agencies are using this uniformed assessment tool, they would be interested in employment candidates who are proficient in the assessment measures. This would save the treatment centers time and money to hire our students who complete this proposed training project. The treatment centers would not have to train the students in assessment, and the students would be able to immediately start conducting assessments, which brings in financial reimbursement to the treatment center.

The project is motivated by the increased uniformity of assessments for substance abuse disorders, the difficulty in the current ASAM forms being used and the demand that all agencies receiving state funds complete through assessments for every client. The assessments are time consuming, and as a result, many agencies are struggling to find the time to complete each assessment.  By training our students to be substance abuse assessors, they would be able to secure employment immediately. Their proficiency in assessment measures would make them more marketable job candidates.",\n,\n,\n

Outcomes include increased enrollment/completion, preparation for emerging workforce, and creation of industry liaisons.","This project addresses a multitude of needs. For the purposes of this rationale we will identify five major categories of need and summarize how this project will address them.
 
For clarity we are calling this position a Pathway Navigator/Liaison. The faculty will be expected to do both. Generally, a Navigator will shepherd students through the program. Responsibilities may include assisting with enrollment, expediting completion paperwork, and guiding students through challenges while at ELAC. A Liaison will provide a bridge to-and-from the program. Responsibilities may include working with feeder programs from K-12 schools, cultivating industry partnerships, and creating internships and job opportunities with potential employers.
 
1) Recruitment
 
We are located in the entertainment capital of the world. Students in the K-12 schools in our service area, however, do not understand the possibilities that these industries offer them for creative expression and financial security. Many of their schools do not have professional art, theater, or media programs.
 
We will address this need by having experienced theater professionals represent and recruit for our program at targeted area high schools. They will present our students’ work and success stories along with true-to-the-industry job descriptions and expectations. The possibilities of our program will be brought to pre-college students in a realistic and meaningful way. These liaisons will develop relationships with like-minded teachers, administrators, and counselors at feeder schools to facilitate and perpetuate this process. They will also create media presentations that can represent our program.
 
These approaches will be useful throughout the school year, but particularly important as the students become eligible to co-enroll in our classes and/or prepare for graduation.
 
 
2) Student Success
 
Well over 1000 students pass through our program every school year. Almost all of them show a potential in the theater arts field, but very few of them go on to complete a certificate or degree which could lead to a meaningful and financially stable career. Our students are frustrated by many life issues including distractions at home, challenges of academic logistics, a lack of proper college-level preparation, and for many being the first in their family to attend college.
 
Our program currently has no specific mechanism for supporting our students. This project will allow us to offer easily accessible consistent support from someone who has worked in their area of interest, understands the curriculum and our school, and can help them stay on the pathway to academic and professional success. The Navigator/Liaison will also help students through the application process for certificates and/or degrees, and can expedite the paperwork from the administrative side. Unlike other support modalities, this faculty member will be aggressively proactive in visiting classrooms, getting information from other faculty, targeting students, and tracking students after exiting. They will be available in the department itself.
 
3) Employment Success  
 
Even when our students attain a professional level of skill and complete our program, many students still lack the soft skills and confidence needed to gain employment. Even though soft skills are a major learning outcome of our CTE classes, we have a persistent idiosyncratic problem. Shy, socially awkward, autistic spectrum students and students with similar challenges are often not able to use the kind of coaching that occurs in a traditional class in this respect.
 
All of our students could benefit from individual coaching, mock interviews, and portfolio/resume reviews that will be offered by our faculty Navigators.
 
In addition to more individualized employment preparation, our Navigator/Liaisons will be able to leverage their industry contacts to create opportunities such as job shadowing, site visits, and guest lectures that would also increase students’ preparation for gainful employment and success.
 
 
4) Untapped Partnership with the Media Arts Department
 
Our program has many areas that significantly overlap with that of the Media Arts Program. This includes but is not limited to employers that potentially would hire students from both programs, high schools and magnet programs that cover both topics, a pool of potential students who are interested in professional art, craft, storytelling and self-expression, an employment system that is heavily tilted towards freelance, entertainment industry events etc.
 
Currently, however, we have no system in place for capitalizing on these commonalities. This proposal will create a strategic partnership by combining efforts in the liaison part of these faculty positions. For instance, our liaison and the liaison from the media arts department could make presentations together at high schools. Because technical theater artists and media artists consistently work together, they have an understanding and appreciation for each other’s professions. Once they have seen and participated in presentations together they will eventually be able to give basic presentations for both programs. This will effectively double the reach of our high school recruitment.

In industry/employment terms most guest lectures and site visits will be of interest to the students of both disciplines. Many professional partners will have job openings in both categories. Employers visiting the college to tour one department would likely be equally interested in seeing the other. Our liaisons will facilitate this.
 
Technical theater students could provide art direction, make up, wardrobe styling and set design for photography students. Photography students could document stagecraft for technical theater students’ portfolios. This project will connect these students.
 
5) Untapped Industry Partnerships
 
If you ask anyone in a position to hire in the Media/Entertainment Industry, they will likely tell you about the gap between what employers need and what the graduates of most schools offer. Having a dedicated liaison can bring consistent communication with our industry partners can help us to close this gap for our students. This can be done in many ways including bringing back specific feedback on our programs and our student portfolios. Also, involving employment decision-makers with the work and education, especially for students who are close to completion, has a powerful effect in both directions. This is especially true in the case of students who might not present well in an interview situation. Employers would have the chance to get to know our students in a different context.
 
6) Social Media Opportunities
 
Social media offers tremendous opportunity for promoting our department, our students, and our classes. At the same time, it is a powerful tool to create a sense of pride and community. Even though we have the content, we lack the ability to consistently and coherently participate on these platforms.
 
Our Navigator/Liaisons will be able to coordinate our social media efforts and increase our new media participation. This can also be leveraged to attract employers, publicize events, increase enrollment, and remind students of important logistical deadlines.

"GOAL 
To establish the Theater in the Community Certificate of Achievement (TICCA) as a guided pathway. 
PROPOSAL 
1. Continue to add the TICCA into the curriculum of area high schools. 
2. Develop contact with area high schools to recruit students to the TICCA. 
3. Establish industry partnerships, internships and job placement opportunities for students. 
OUTCOME
Students directed to the TICCA in high school and earn a degree are guided into the workforce through strong industry partnerships.  ","The 'Theater in the Community' Certificate of Achievement, (TICCA), curriculum
is designed specifically to prepare students for alternative career opportunities in
theater. Besides direct employment in the stage or film industry there are myriad opportunities for employment in education, recreation and social service and community based not-for-profit theater. These include teaching assistant, teaching artist, childcare worker, recreational assistant, gerontology aide, assistant gerontology activity director and children's or community theater education specialist.  As such the curriculum is built around two practicum courses, Children's Theater and Inter-Generational Theater Performance Workshop Practicum. The courses provide job related, site-based experiences for students with workshops and performances for both populations.  In addition, the certificate requires students to complete a course in child development and gerontology, a stage management or directing course and stagecraft. The keystone course is The Arts in the Community. A key component of the course is to develop awareness of alternative professional careers and opportunities in education and auxiliary professions. (See Attachment #1, TICCA Curriculum) Upon completion of the certificate the student should possess the requisite marketable skills to enter the educational, health, recreational or social service industry as a Creative Theater Specialist or to continue on to a four-year degree with a pre-determined emphasis in education, applied therapeutic theater, dance, psychology or sociology. In addition, the certificate can be attached to either a Child Development degree or stacked with a Gerontology/Health Certificate offered by the Child, Family and Education Studies Department. TICCA’s curriculum was written and approved in the spring semester of 2017 and classes from the certificate scheduled in the fall of 2017 by the Department of Theater.

However, in order to make the certificate truly viable as a career pathway and
successful as a tool for workforce entry it is necessary to a.) Continue to implement the TICCA into the curriculum of ELAC feeder high schools. The groundwork for this goal has already been laid. A Linked Learning Pathway was started with Esteban Torres High School Performing Arts Magnet in the fall of 2017 and both articulated and dual enrollment classes from the certificate will be offered at Esteban Torres in the spring, summer and fall of 2018. The implementation of the TICCA at the high school level is important because the certificate and pathway can now be introduced at other LAUSD high schools and proposed to the Alhambra, Montebello, Southgate and other area school districts as a viable workable program. b.) To make high school students, counselors and parents aware of the TICCA and career and workforce entry options that it provides and then c.)
Upon completion of a degree and the certificate provide students with solid civil
and industry connections, internships and viable job opportunities that will ensure
their success upon entering the workforce or continuing on to a four-year
institution. (See Attachment #2, TICCA Career Pathways)
To that end the SWI grant will be used to employ a high school liaison, preferably an alumnus of ELAC Theater Department, who will contact area high school counselors and theatre teachers to introduce them to TICCA and start implementation of the certificate to their curriculum,  to conduct informational and activity based workshops for students about the TICCA and develop and organize summer and winter vacation ‘theatre bootcamps’. The high school liaison will also contact and establish relationships with California Educational Theatre Association, Drama Teachers Association of Southern California and California State Thespians for presentations at meetings and conventions. 
The grant also will employ an industry liaison who will contact and establish working relationships with civil and industry partners, establish internships and arrange for and track employment opportunities from but not limited to: public and municipal organizations in the city and county of Los Angeles and surrounding communities including the Department of Recreation & Parks, Department of Housing, Department of Community and Senior Services, Department of Aging, after-school programs administered by LAUSD, private after-school programs that service LAUSD and other area school districts, private and not-for-profit day care, youth, educational, arts and recreation organizations and private and not-for-profit social service agencies and companies serving older adults. In addition, the following theaters companies will be contacted: Casa 101, Cornerstone Theatre, Kaiser Permanente Educational Theater, Santa Monica Playhouse and Los Angeles Theatre Center.

"We plan to develop a holistic Cyber Security program to educate students at Chaffey College in order to open opportunities for students to train in this very dynamic, opportunity packed, and high paying field. Chaffey’s Cyber Security Education Program goal will be to produce students with an Associate Degree in Cyber Security, provide transfer pathways to the University Systems, and train work-ready Cyber Security Analysts.  Student pathways include plans for articulation and dual enrollment.","Our early research yielded the following information: 
*In the US, the Cyber Security profession is growing at a rate of 36.5% per year, 
*More than 209,000 Cyber Security jobs in the U.S. are unfilled, 
*An estimated one million Cyber Security Related Job Openings in 2016, 
*Cyber Security Professional job openings will grow at a rate of 9% faster than other Information Technology (IT) jobs in the US, 
*Information Security Analyst with an Associate’s Degree and no experience has a salary potential of $58k per year in our current Metropolitan Service Area (MSA),  
*The CSUSB Cyber Security Program is impacted and Chaffey currently does not have a Cyber Security education program 

With great outlook for employment, and the limited number of educational opportunities in Cyber Security Career Technical Education (CTE) available in the region, this presented an excellent opportunity for us to advance, educate and increase the employment potential for Chaffey students. At Chaffey College, we feel that the students in our service area are missing gainful employment opportunities in the MSA.  Driving is the knowledge that there is a large market demand for skilled Cyber Security professionals and closely related fields in the MSA and beyond.  Doing further research and requesting a Labor Market Information (LMI) study, we learned the following:?	In 2016, the MSA had 9,565 job openings in security or closely related fields with average annual earnings of $96,800 per year
*The MSA has an expected 11% increase in opportunities in Cyber Security and related fields through 2021
*With CSUSB’s impacted Cyber Security Program unable to fully serve the region, there is a limited number of training education opportunities available to students
*Creating a Cyber Security program at Chaffey is crucially important for students and the region
*Employment for the database design and administration occupational group, a closely related filed, is expected to increase by 9% through 2021. Nearly 1,200 job openings will be available over the five-year time frame in the Inland Empire/ Desert Region
*In 2016, there were more than 2,850 database design and administration occupational group jobs in the Inland Empire/Desert Region

Based on all available information, it is critical that we develop a Cyber Security Education program as a part of a computer infrastructure and support education program. Our project rational is focused on long term student success.  To produce students that can effectively land and keep a job, the students must be educated holistically in technology, have excellent skills and the ability to think critically; student outcomes will benefit from a holistic education in technology and Cyber Security with courses that can align with industry certificates. Students must be capable of preforming Cyber Security related tasks and understanding the consequences of decisions made and the possible repercussions.  Additionally, and most importantly, students must be able to perform root cause analysis and develop plans for dealing with security related scenarios.  For example, if data is being exfiltrated from a network, an employee who is not educated holistically may simply opt to block the ports data is being exfiltrated from and rebuild the machine from which the exfiltration has occurred.  However, a root cause analysis trained employee would utilize additional tools/decisions such as monitoring traffic to the end destination and studying the infected machine to understand the mechanism being used.  Then using a systems administration method, such as using the hash value of the application, to prevent the program from running on future systems.  The latter concept is taught in an information technology course related to, but not necessarily a part of, a Cyber Security course. Therefore, our rational is to approach security education from an engineering and systems administration perspective firstly, to provide a foundation for deep and effective Cyber Security learning.

To build a high quality Cyber Security education program, firstly, we need to evaluate the needs of our constituents and formulate pathways with all the potential stakeholders.  To do so, we will focus on regional coordination, and work with community partners, California State University, local business and other schools to build articulation, dual enrollment and career pathways. As a facet of regional coordination, we will evaluate and revise CTE curriculum approval process and look for ways to streamline the process, improve program evaluation, disseminate effective CTE practices, reduce repetition, and facilitate common courses for portability (Taskforce Recommendations alignment: 8, 9, 10, 11, 12).  Regional coordination will focus on creating a CTE faculty working group that will work with the Inland Empire - Desert Regional Consortium to strengthen communication and coordination, enhance course articulation, develop leadership and operational partnerships, and develop robust connections between High schools, Chaffey and industry (Taskforce Recommendations alignment: 17,18,19,20). 

Secondly, to ensure student success and CTE outcomes, the plan will build a model curriculum to share with key stakeholders.  We will then take the model curriculum and build courses to support it.  Our curriculum will be made up of four Cyber Security strands.  Each student can elect to focus on one strand based on his/her interest or career pathway.  Each strand will have an Associates and/or Certificate associated with it (Taskforce Recommendations alignment: 7, 3).  The four proposed security strands are: 
*Systems Security and Administration
  ~Will focus on systems management, support and security
  ~Reasoning: LMI Computer Infrastructure, Support, and Security Occupations
*Application Development and Security
   ~Will focus on software development, database development and security
   ~Reasoning: LMI Database Design and Administration Occupations
*Cloud Security and Administration
   ~Will focus on public and private cloud Infrastructure management and security
   ~Reasoning: LMI Computer Infrastructure, Support, and Security Occupations
*Network Security and Administration
   ~Will focus on network infrastructure management and security
   ~Reasoning: LMI Computer Infrastructure, Support, and Security Occupations

The curriculum development process will be in alignment with any existing ICD, CSU courses and industry recognized certificates (Taskforce Recommendations alignment: 7). Course work will begin with Computer Information Systems 1 (CIS1), which will broaden and enhance career exploration and planning for students (Taskforce Recommendations alignment: 1). After CIS1, students will focus on foundational skills such as windows administration or basic networking.  Then student focus shifts from foundational to core security courses such as Ethical Hacking and Security+.  After core security courses, student learning will fork into one of four capstone security threads in Development, Networking, Cloud and Systems.  Completing the core and capstone courses will allow students to test in industry recognized certifications and improve CTE student outcomes (Taskforce Recommendations alignment: 2). Having students that are certificated and work ready will allow the students to take advantage of industry-informed career pathways.  With these certificates and industry focused pathways, students can be employed in jobs that are needed within the regional labor market today and tomorrow (Taskforce Recommendations alignment: 3). Our program will also involve creating a ‘tech day’ on campus to invite industry representatives and expose students to technology careers and curriculum 
(Taskforce Recommendations alignment: 7, 3, 11). 

However, having a frame work without faculty to support it will not be sustainable. Our project’s third task will focus on adding CTE Cyber Security faculty, increase professional development, and explore adding industry professionals as Cyber Security faculty. As CTE faculty are increased, we will explore sustainable ways of increasing professional development for those faculty (Taskforce Recommendations alignment: 13,14,15,16). CTE faculty will use professional development to improve and update skills to contemporaneously: 
*Guide students to setup virtual machines to demonstrate security topics across multiple platforms
*Guide students to build systems with built-in flaws and allow students to experiment with exploiting the systems
*Guide the students to fix system issues and prevent future exploitation
*Guide the students with building enterprise systems
*Guide the students on software development with limited security flaws
*Guide the students on exploitation of weak of weak software
*Guide the students on securing Embedded Systems for Industry
*Guide students on digital forensics
*Guide students on the use, management and security of public, private and hybrid clouds
*Guide students on the ethics of security

Fourth, our program use our newly and existing relationships to create a tracking mechanism to track CTE students, starting from high school, through our college and into employment or higher education. This data will be crucial for us to determine the long-term effectiveness of our curriculum. 

Finally, long term funding needs can be minimized via purchasing and setting up an on campus virtual infrastructure.  Having on premises infrastructure that can be modified as technology trends change will help create a funding model that is low cost and can be sustained via public outreach to the community and industry (Taskforce Recommendations alignment: 21, 22, 23).  Our goal is to create a long term, self-sufficient Cyber Security Education program at low long-term cost.  Developing such a program will allow Chaffey to be a beacon and model program for other institutions to follow. ",\n,\n,\n

"•	An updated greenhouse will increase the quality our of CTE program by providing new job skills to students in emerging fields of horticulture called Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA), or indoor agriculture. These new skills acquired by the students will offer either immediate access to jobs or provide them opportunities to further their studies in CEA at universities that have advanced degrees in the subject such as Cal Poly, Pomona or the University of Arizona at Tucson. ","Proponents estimate that indoor agriculture has the potential to be a $9 billion industry, and as such, could transform communities and reduce unemployment. The growing networks of hydroponic greenhouses and vertical farms have the potential to relocate food production to urban and suburban areas, where Americans have been migrating for a few decades now. The United Nations projects that by 2030, 53 urban areas in the United States will have populations of at least 1 million—up from 41 cities in 2010. All those people will need to eat and work.
Indoor farming—“future farming” or “Ag 3.0,” as some have called it—is expanding rapidly in many areas as a way to grow food and economies in and around cities. Greenhouse jobs also differ significantly from those in traditional agriculture. Where a rural farm mainly needs people focused on the crops, building an indoor farm can require designers and architects, plus skilled laborers to construct, wire, and pipe the growing system. Workers in tech-heavy greenhouses and vertical farms, the wages can be better than they would be on rural farms. An urban indoor grower can earn as much as $65,000 starting out, while a master grower with a PhD can earn up to $90,000 annually. That’s a far cry from workers in traditional agriculture, who earn an average of $19,000 annually or $9.30 per hour, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. http://ponicjobs.com/ is a live a job search engine for positions within his emerging space, and an opportunity to observe the job prospects that are available now.

According to a recent white paper, “Indoor Crop Production, Feeding the Future,*” March 2015, “With a total addressable market size of over $9bn-or 17x the current market size-indoor agriculture is poised to be the next major enhancement to the American food supply.”
The market growth of hydroponic greenhouses, vertical farms, container farms and in-home systems is valued at a growth potential of $9bn dollars. California has 28% of total market share of large greenhouse companies in production when measured against the entire U.S. Market. California is a leader in the local food movement with major growth opportunities forecasted.
The labor demand for skilled professionals in indoor lighting systems, control system hardware, management of water, nutrients and the minimization of pesticides on edible crops will only continue to grow as the market expands. 
	No community college is addressing this expected shortfall of trained labor in this market space.  With the requested resources, our Horticulture Program would be able to meet this gap and provide a highly skilled labor force for the next decade when the growth in this space will be at it’s highest demand.
	While our current program has been dedicated to the ornamental horticulture industry, it is time to look forward and adapt to rapidly changing world of Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA). Nationwide, Ornamental Horticulture Programs at all levels of academic institutions are shutting down due to their inability to adapt to changing market conditions and the revolution going on in CEA. The institutions that have embraced the new era of CEA are flourishing and attracting new students interested in this high tech approach to agriculture. As a result they are placing their highly trained students in CEA jobs nationwide and worldwide. We have an opportunity to capitalize on this phenomenon that is here to stay and provide job training to the next generation of horticulture students. The cost of the retrofit is very small in comparison to the ROI for our students. 


Locally grown produce will supplement the nations food chain, the indoor agriculture movement
is positioning itself to create a new industry and new jobs. “Indoor farming will never replace conventional outdoor farming methods, “it will instead augment the food chain to create a diverse, distributed system more resilient to supply shocks and better prepared to meet the demands of a global population.”*

In addition, according to a new market research report ""Smart Greenhouse Market by Technology (HVAC, LED Grow Light, Communication Technology, Irrigation System, Material Handling, Valves & Pumps, Control System, and Others), Type (Hydroponic, Non-hydroponic), and Geography - Forecast to 2020"", published by Markets and Markets, the Smart Greenhouse Market is expected to increase to more than USD 1.2 Billion by 2020, growing at a CAGR of 14.18% between 2015 and 2020.*

Vocational programs such as the Fullerton College Horticulture Department have an opportunity to train thousands of students in this emerging industry. This is a moment in time to acknowledge that our program as it currently stands is unsustainable as the ornamental horticulture industry continues to shrink due to California’s mega drought, consolidation of nurseries, and reduction in demand due to an aging population and decline in construction. “Today, the trend is toward the development and establishment of controlled environments for all manner of horticulture, generally involving more monitoring and control, as well as considerable automation. CEA production has been growing very rapidly as an industry. Today there are 650 acres of greenhouse production representing 427 farmers in California with an estimated annual production value of $165 million.  New indoor operations are starting throughout the state and growers are asking for advice. (Bethke, J.,Lieth, H., http://ucnfanews.ucanr.edu/, 2017)

"Chaffey College offers the only Interior Design Program in the Inland Empire Region.  The program trains students in many areas including construction systems, building codes, architectural drafting, retail furniture procurement and sales, construction material procurement and sales, product design and general interior design of facilities needed for priority sectors targeted in the Strong Workforce Initiative.  Students are also trained in entrepreneurship in several areas.","The employment for the interior design occupational group in the San Bernardino region is expected to increase 3% over the next 5 years.  This increase is greater than the 1% projected for the Los Angeles and Orange County regions.  This amounts to over 1835 new and replacement jobs in the field of interior design in the San Bernardino region.  Median wage for Interior Designers in the region is $21.01 per hour and entry level wages are between $16.07 to $30.13. This is above the living wage. The Chaffey College Interior Design Program is the only interior design program offered in this community college region.  Chaffey College Interior Design Program has an opportunity for growth according the C.O.E Occupational group summary (Dec. 2017).  Total number of interior design course enrollments at Chaffey College 2015-2016 year was 258.  Degrees conferred in 2015 were 12 Associate of Science degrees and 11 certificates. Some students receive both upon graduation.   Strong workforce Metrics for the region states employment data is unavailable for 2015-2016, however, most recent available data from 2012-2013 states that 61% of students are employed in the second fiscal quarter after exit and 70% are employed in the fourth quarter after exit.  All Metrics for the region are from Chaffey alone since it is the only program offered in the region.  There are no four-year interior design programs offered by California State Universities in the Inland Empire region to offset the small number of graduates. An opportunity exists to create a transfer pathway to SDSU, and CSULB interior design programs.  When advertised, 85% of employers prefer a Bachelor’s degree for interior designers.  Unfortunately, for the 2018-2019 academic year both programs are impacted but it is assumed that entering Junior year students would be able to transfer in from Chaffey College.   
The Chaffey College Interior Design Program is looking to re-evaluate, expand and improve the curriculum in several ways.  First, to expand on the immediate employment after 12 units of study in Visual Communication and Technical Drafting by offering a stackable certificate.  This option is recommended in the advisory committee meeting dated November 2017.  The skills gained after the 12 unit certificate would provide the student immediate employment opportunities in key target sectors as CAD support personnel for industries such as construction, sustainable design, manufacturing, and engineering as well as interior design.  Second, curriculum improvements of writing new courses to include the study of manual drafting and codes that will prepare the graduates for the CID certification exam in California which will provide an additional level of expertise needed in the workforce. Third, to modify curriculum to guarantee articulation to the 4 year programs offered by Cal State for transfer students.  
In addition to curricular development, the Interior Design Program is in need of appropriate industry specific equipment, desks and software.  Currently, the interior design program has 1 dedicated classroom with new desktop computers for 24 students.  The desks currently in use are not intended for interior design study.  The inadequate desks do not allow for use of drafting equipment and portable drafting tables are set on top of the desks for temporary student use.  The classroom has very little storage capacity for interior design materials and has inefficient instructor visualizing equipment for the demonstration of drafting, and drawing which comprise a large portion of visual communications required in the workforce.  In order for the interior design students to prepare for the workforce, upgrades to the classroom and teaching equipment are necessary.
The program is also in need of qualified adjunct faculty, specifically those who are expert in History of Architecture, CAD programs, codes and drawing.  A recruitment effort is required to find qualified faculty. 
Finally, the Interior Design Program moved from the Rancho Cucamonga Campus to the Chino Campus in 2010 and through a lack of advertising, community outreach and a full time faculty, many assumed the program was discontinued.  In addition, since the program had been without a full-time faculty for 8 years, curriculum revisions were not a priority. There is a very strong indication that through marketing efforts, faculty development, facility improvements and curriculum updates, Chaffey College has a tremendous potential to expand the Interior Design Program and therefore provide much-needed qualified Interior Designers and those qualified for employment in related fields to the workforce in the Inland Empire.  There exists a tremendous opportunity to lessen the gap of qualified graduates to available jobs in the upcoming years for the region. ",\n,\n,\n

The project addresses estimated demand of 3,200 job openings annually in the LA/OC region, with median hourly earnings ranging from $19 to $37. Supply/Demand in Orange County is 583 annual completers versus a demand of 846.","Economic and labor market research are the primary drivers for this project:  1) Annual demand for the target occupations in Orange County is 846 versus 583 completers. 2) New competencies are needed in all target occupations to accommodate industry trends in Building Automation and industrial Automation. 3) Policies and incentives arising from California’s clean energy and pollution reduction mandates continue to accelerate industry’s evolution to automated solutions. 4) Policies and incentives for adoption of Industrial Automation systems are at the core of California’s strategy for economic growth and competitiveness in the global market Legislation such as Proposition 39 continues to create new jobs by infusing hundreds of millions of dollars annually in energy efficient buildings and by incentivizing new private investments. 

New technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Direct Digital Control, Smart Sensors, Analytical Engines, and Artificial Intelligence dominate the   way buildings and processes must respond to these drivers. The Orange County workforce is not well prepared to support this level of investment or the sophistication of new Automation technologies. In addition to the supply/demand and new worker competency gaps, multiple studies show a massive need to upskill the incumbent workforce. Orange County colleges have a significant portfolio of  programs related to Automation, and a number of mechanical and electrical career pathways, most of which need to be upgraded to address new competencies in Automation. This region offers an ideal platform to develop strategies, best practices, and evidence that can be replicated and scaled across the state. The Automation Pathways project has evolved through inputs from faculty and Deans across the  region. Colleges that will benefit most from this initiative offer programs in Process Control, HVACR, Water/Wastewater, Building Automation, Industrial Automation, Robotics, Data Analytics, and Cybersecurity. At the project’s core is an “Expert Network” in Orange County that cultivates credit transferability and stackable credentials across multiple colleges. The primary purpose of the Expert Network is facilitate collaboration and experimentation to advance student  success  in Automation disciplines. Engaging faculty with major Automation systems  manufacturers and professional services firms, this Network develops common  student learning outcomes that are aligned with competencies in greatest demand by industry. A focus on “employability by design” creates relationships between employers and colleges for work-based learning and employment of completers.

These same relationships help faculty infuse industry workforce standards into curriculum that enhance marketability of students from participating colleges, and provide a basis for lifelong learning through  continuing  education.  Recognizing existing demands on faculty, this project assist in curriculum alignment and development by funding consultants to work at the direction of faculty. It also  provides funding for adjunct instructors to deliver specialized Automation modules that are infused into existing courses and programs. Orange County’s Expert Network is the primary focus of an existing statewide industry advisory comprised of the the Association of Controls Professionals, Siemens, Johnson Controls, Honeywell, Lutron, Cisco, and others with a strong presence in the county. Significant contributions to  this advisory are being made by UC Irvine and the National Science Foundation BEST Center. This initiative includes: 1) Alignment of student learning outcomes across the region’s programs. 2) Transfer of certificate or degree-level credits across participating colleges. 3) Convening and sustaining an Expert Network that engages industry in faculty planning. 4) Professional development for faculty, aligned  with  industry priorities. 5) A community of practice for sharing curricula and building evidence for replication and scaling. 6) Engagement of consultants to support faculty in curriculum alignment and development. 7) Leveraging NSF and US Department of Energy Automation initiatives. 8) Investment in equipment. 9) Assessment of outcomes and continuous improvement of Network processes Collaboration among the colleges will define a three-year career pathway development strategy and implement the first year’s plan.

"The Next Gen project will continue and extend the reach of work currently being done through the Round 1-funded project in Drone and Autonomous Systems Technology.  The program focus includes both the traditional aviation-based flying “drone” technology program areas and the broader core autonomous systems technology at the heart of drone systems at use in aerial, aquatic and terrestrial (ground) applications.  Broad employment potential exists for students completing training programs.","Drone and autonomous systems technology is undergoing exponentially accelerating technological growth and evolutionary change in the 21st Century global economy.  A recent study conducted by the federal government indicates that investments in “drone” technology, including a broad range of unmanned, autonomous vehicles and automated systems will reach or exceed $82 billion between 2015 and 2025, adding over 100,000 jobs in California alone.  
Reports issued by California State University at Fullerton and Orange County Business Council name the Orange County region as a central hub for development and growth of this technology for a broad variety of businesses and sectors, including film/TV/Video, photography,  business/marketing, biotechnology, retail fulfillment, Ecommerce, theme park technology,  public safety, hospitality, and consumer product and service development. OCBC reports the local business community’s long-term goal to be recognized as the “Innovation County.” This creates a dynamic economic environment in which occupational and workforce development opportunities abound. This evolution and the market opportunities in Orange County, California and across the globe utilizing drones/robotics and their core control technologies stand out in importance and impact as economic drivers in new and emerging sectors.    Opportunities for skilled workers to design, build, operate, apply, maintain, and invent new products and uses of this technology abound, creating a “blue sky” need and gap that community colleges can fill with new and expanded programs.  In addition, a clear need exists for a structure and aligned, strategic approach to outreach and marketing of these pathways, programs and job opportunities.  
 
Community colleges have a unique opportunity to be THE recognized center and convener of invested stakeholders focused on identifying and matching employer needs and the career aspirations of students.  The complexity of ASC and drone-related technologies and the workforce that is developing around them requires a managed, aligned collaborative, systemic and future-focused responses by community colleges. 
Several colleges are already active in the drone and autonomous systems field including: Cypress College (program approved and courses being offered), Golden West College, Santiago Canyon College, Fullerton College, and Orange Coast College (program approved at the local level, pending approval by the Chancellor’s office).   This effort will not only help colleges with programs currently in place, but help other colleges to create or build on their existing strenths and strategic visions for the future.  Efforts and outcomes from the Round 1 project will be incorporated in the expanded collaborative group which can be inclusive of additional college partners with existing CTE and transfer programs aimed at careers in:
•	Sensors and Controls
•	Internet of Things
•	Photography/Videography/Film
•	Advanced Manufacturing/Robotics
•	ICT and computer programming/coding
•	Engineering and Aviation technology
•	Avionics
•	Aviation Science
•	Law Enforcement and Public Safety
•	Homeland Security
•	Real Estate
•	Theme Park Technology

No one college or program currently has all the integrated elements of a unified program, which opens the door for development of a coherent network of regional programs with specialties and college “hubs” for specialized or focused pathways.  Program and curriculum development across sectors with drone development will be required, tied to emerging specific occupations locally and regionally. There are a significant number of businesses and occupations and prospective occupations associated with broad drone and ASC technologies in Orange County and their needs could and will be answered by this effort.

To summarize: the primary needs for our region is to answer the requirements of employers, provide the maximum amounts of opportunities,  and to identify new methods for innovation and collaboration around a rapidly evolving field.  This Collective answers all those needs.",\n,\n,\n
"Ventura College will support a Career Education Faculty Liaison and multiple projects that increase the number of students enrolled in and completing Career Education (CE) programs that lead to high demand, high wage jobs.  Projects include CE curriculum alignment and increased CE course offerings, interdisciplinary projects that provide students with hands-on learning experiences, enhanced faculty and industry partnerships, marketing, and academic support services.","Additional support and resources for Career Education faculty and programs are needed to allow CE programs to reach their full potential.  Budgetary concerns have limited Ventura College's ability to offer new and additional Career Education courses and lack of human capital, with many CE programs being limited to one full-time faculty member, has hindered innovation and collaboration across related disciplines.  The CE Liaison will represent CE faculty concerns",\n,\n,\n
"The Careers in Education (CIE) Pathway Collaborative will be designed to address the educator shortage in the region and the state, focusing on students’ early employment as program and teacher assistants in pre-schools, after school    care programs, and aides in K-12 or special education. The CIE Pathway programs will at the same time help to coordinate this early employment with on-going education toward higher levels of education and employment as K-12 teachers.","There are 17,150 teacher openings due to replacements alone in Southern California (EDD), which reflects the high percentage of teachers near retirement: 40% of CA teachers are over 50 (Fong, 2015). Yet, enrollment in California teacher preparation programs has plummeted, declining by 66% over the past decade (CA Teacher Credentialing Commission). This situation has educational leaders concerned that there will be a severe teacher shortage: ""the state could easily face `very severe shortages' of teachers...It takes a long time for the pipeline to recover...Prompt action is needed to prepare new teachers and avert a significant loss of educational quality"" (Freedberg, 2015). The Learning Policy Institute report (2017) identifies that stagnant teacher supply is insufficient to meet growing teacher demand. In the past year, California’s teacher shortage has worsened as demand continues to grow and the supply of new teachers remains stagnant. New California credentials have remained constant at 11,500 since 2013–14, while growing projected annual new hires have grown and now exceed 20,000. According to a Center of Teaching and Learning report in February 2017, in the past year, overall teacher workforce trends in California have worsened, with especially severe consequences in special education, math,  and  science,  and significant threats in bilingual education. Survey data suggest that, in addition to canceling courses and increasing class sizes, districts are responding to shortages by hiring underprepared teachers (teachers who have not yet completed the subject matter and teacher preparation requirements for a full credential); assigning some teachers out of their fields of preparation; and hiring substitutes, who need only pass   a basic skills test. Relying on underprepared, out-of-field, and substitute teachers is      a cause for concern. Evidence shows that these teachers typically depress student achievement and have higher attrition rates. The high attrition rates of underprepared teachers create continuous demand for new teachers and exacerbate shortages.
Moreover, schools serving the most vulnerable students, including students in high- poverty, high-minority, and high-English Learner schools, disproportionately turn to underprepared teachers to meet their hiring needs. Increasing enrollment in the CIE pathway not only addresses the workforce need for qualified educators, it also connects students to high-wage jobs: paraprofessionals in our region can earn up to
$23/hour and the average teacher salary in our region is $80,363. The proposed CIE pathway leads to high-skill, high-growth, high-wage paraprofessional and teaching occupations. Employment Development Department (EDD) LMI data show regional growth in paraprofessional and teacher openings at 10%-11%, with 392 paraprofessional openings, and 524 teacher openings, on average each year. The wage range for paraprofessionals in our area is $13-$23/hr, based on training and certification. This is a significant increase over the minimum wage that most of our students earn in retail and food service jobs, and contributes to students' persistence in the pathway as their earnings and their work experience support their goal to enter the teaching profession. Need for Teachers Better Prepared in STEM to Increase STEM Majors As economic growth and social well-being have come to depend more on STEM fields, educators need to effectively prepare students to enter and lead in STEM-related industries. California students ranked next to last among all states participating in the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) science assessments (US Dept. of Education, 2009). Our students struggle in math and science, especially underrepresented students, due in part to teachers' discomfort and limited knowledge in these disciplines. A study funded by the National Science Foundation found that many teachers felt unprepared to teach math and science, and are not confident that they can provide effective math or science instruction to a diverse group of learners (Epstein, 2014). The Careers in Education Pathway Collaborative will provide extensive pre-professional development, work experience, and externship opportunities, emphasizing effective inquiry-based math and science instruction, as well as integrate math and science skills development into the pathway. The Careers in Education Pathway Collaborative complements the region's goals for STEM-related CTE pathways, as improvement of K-12 math and science instruction is a necessary strategy to prepare the STEM workforce. Science and math are no longer subjects among many, but disciplines on which our future depends: ""professions in eight of the 10 industry clusters identified by the Orange County Workforce Investment Board require STEM competencies and skills,"" and ""Orange County believes that the development of a STEM competent workforce and citizenry begins with preschoolers and continues at every step of the education continuum thereafter"" (OC STEM Initiative). There is a critical need for professional development for future and current teachers: only 1/3 of teachers feel very prepared to teach science, and 85% of elementary teachers have not received any science- related professional development in the last three years (Center for the Future of Teaching and Learning, 2014). 

to the high need for teachers in general, there is a persistent need for more Hispanic, bilingual, and teachers from ethnic minorities that better reflect the communities they serve. Consider the number of Hispanic students at our county LEAs compared with the number of Hispanic teachers: 66% of students are Hispanic, but only 15% of teachers are Hispanic (California Department of Education, 2016). In order to do this, community colleges not only need to prepare students along the pathway for early employment working in educational environments, but increase the transfer rates of Hispanic students and other underrepresented minority group students. Though there has been increased full college Hispanic transfer rates from  the three HSI (Hispanic Serving Institutions) campuses in the region, there is still   much work to be done. While White student enrollment is approximately only a quarter of the colleges’ populations, white students transfer at much higher rates   than Hispanic students which are nearly the majority population enrolled at the campuses. Need to Develop/Strengthen Careers In Education Pathways among the Nine Community Colleges and Local School District CIE Pathways Careers in Education courses exist in all three of the OC ROPs (Central Orange County- CTEp/NOCROP/Coastline ROP), yet only a few community colleges have formal articulation agreements with one or more high school programs for this pathway. In order to increase streamlined Careers in Education pathways throughout Orange County, time and resources need to be dedicated to establish community college/K-  12 partnerships, develop curriculum and articulation/dual enrollment agreements, and build infrastructure practices and processes that are sustainable. Need to Strengthen Regional Communication and Coordination in the Education Sector Currently model programs exist with articulated programs, stackable certificates, robust work based learning experiences, and employment acquisition, and however, these efforts are isolated to two campuses in the region. Therefore there is a need to develop connections between the model program campuses and the other seven community colleges, their feeder high schools, ROPs and local employers to facilitate the replication of these exemplary models therefore addressing the workforce needs in the region",\n,\n,\n

According to the Center of Excellence’s 2013 Advanced Manufacturing Employer Survey Results, “For six of the eight occupations studied, employers indicated college/trade school as the desired education requirement for employment. Employers found the most difficulty hiring applicants with 3D Modeling knowledge for all eight of the occupations studied…” Other emerging trends in the advanced manufacturing world were:

1.	Additive (3D printing) Manufacturing
2.	Apps and digital textbooks for students
3.	Partnerships between colleges and local industry
4.	Para-professionals teaching at the community college level
5.	Soft skills workshops to make community college students more competent candidates for job openings

The Make to Manufacturing: Advanced Manufacturing Playbook stated that, “California has the largest number of manufacturing jobs, 1,254,300.22.  Unsurprisingly, California is also the largest state contributor to the total U.S. manufacturing GDP at 11.4%, valued at $239 billion in 2013.24. Between 2010 and 2014, total manufacturing employment expanded by 3.1% in the state. (Total state employment grew by 9.2%.) Employment gains were seen in 14 of 18 manufacturing sectors…”

"Three new CTE Illustration area skills certificates have been created, and are due for approval in 2019. These are the Visual Storytelling Specialization Certificate, the Children’s Book Illustration Specialization Certificate, and Storyboarding Specialization Skills Certificate. In order to train these current and projected students in technology that is industry standard, we need to be able to provide digital drawing tablets, on an ongoing basis, in our digital labs and classrooms.","Our students need to be able to access state-of-the-art and industry standard printers, scanners, digital drawing platforms, and computers in order to succeed in school, and in their careers after completing the programs. The field of Illustration can include careers in art direction, story-boarding for motion pictures and animation, toy and product design, fashion design, multimedia artists and animators, as well as craft and fine artists. A more generalized term for the field is Graphic Artists. The median annual wage for specific areas of Illustration and graphic artists: art directors: $89,820 in 2016; multimedia artists and animators: $65,300 in 2016; craft and fine artists: $48,780 in 2016. The State of California projects that between 2014-2024, 461,700 jobs will be created in the Art, Design and Entertainment occupations, that is in annual openings - due to growth, of 4,990 jobs per year.
The State of California projects that the overall employment of art directors is projected to grow 5 percent from 2016 to 2026, about as fast as the average for all occupations. Art directors will continue to be needed to oversee the work of graphic designers, illustrators, photographers, and others who design artwork and layouts. The State of California projects that the overall employment of multimedia artists and animators is projected to grow 8 percent from 2016 to 2026, about as fast as the average for all occupations. Projected growth will be due to increased demand for animation and visual effects in video games, movies, and television. The State of California projects that the overall employment of craft and fine artists is projected to grow 6 percent from 2016 to 2026, about as fast as the average for all occupations. Employment growth for artists depends in large part on the overall state of the economy and whether people are willing to spend money on art, because people usually make art purchases when they can afford to spend the money.

"The proposed project is to remodel our current recording studio control room to allow us to appropriately accommodate students and offer an industry standard learning environment. Currently the control room accommodates a maximum of eight to nine students. The space does not allow for a industry standard critical listening environment in stereo thus making surround sound not possible.","Currently, our Recording 1 and 2 classes have up to 22 students enrolled which is not an inviting learning environment. Given the current conditions I have observed that a contingent of students are left on the fringe without ample opportunity to have the hands­on experience to apply what is being taught. As enrollment in these programs is projected to increase the problem would only be exacerbated. This space needs to be redesigned acoustically and enlarged. This could be achieved by gaining access to the adjacent instrument storage and music library room to expand the classroom. This proposal will include augmenting the storage space in the band room to accommodate the instrument storage that will be needed due to the proposed modifications. This also allows for secure storage of instruments between recording session for which these instruments are needed. This will be a key element in increasing the quantity and quality of the graduates that we effectively output into the industry.

The recording program also needs to be supplemented and outfitted with current hardware and software. The music industry is constantly changing to serve the needs of the industry and as we are training students to enter these job markets, their preparation on comparable tools is essential. The value of their education and subsequent job opportunities is contingent upon access to the most up to date technology, practices, and workflows.

The Music Technology program at Fullerton College is limited by outdated hardware and software that students have access to. It is imperative to offer current reliable analog hardware and software upgrades that are currently being employed in our field. This proposal will increase the quality of our program by providing facilities, hardware and software that will help students to ascertain a real world experience that will better prepare them for success.

Purchasing current sample libraries for the interactive scoring and post­ production classes allows us to prepare students for the growing audio in video gaming, web design and interactive media opportunities.
 


Current gaming and website companies contain fully orchestrated scores that use libraries by the Vienna Symphony Library as well as East West and Best Service.
We need to invest in field recorders to address live recording techniques that are in high demand given that the industry now markets live 360 degree streaming videos of concerts around the world.

Students who choose a pathway to a four­year degree are going to be measurably more successful when they have had experience and access to industry standard tools and protocols.

The proposed projects will expand our program offerings and allow us to develop post­production and audio for video gaming courses as well as augmented and virtual reality audio courses. This grant would also enhance the visibility of our Music Technology program within our educational community.

If we do not update our program facilities, hardware and software, we stand to lose students to surrounding Colleges that have invested in current and emerging technologies. Recruiting will be more effective as we add the missing components that other colleges offer (e.g Citrus College, Musicians Institute and Glendale Community College). Students take into consideration access to state of the art facilities, equipment and technology that a program has to offer when planning their educational experience. If we do not provide a program that mimics an industry standard environment we simply cannot compete to offer our students a comprehensive educational experience.

This field cuts across all disciplines of the manufacturing and service related fields (Bio-Manufacturing; Aerospace, Defense; Pharmaceutical; Electronic; Medical Device; Automotive; Consumer goods, etc.)

The expected potential CTE student population that will be served could be as many 100-120 per year for next several years. This number is based on the fact that companies will need to maintain their competitive edge against foreign competition. Our Next Generation Precision Machining and Manufacturing program is designed to give the student a solid foundation in various types of manufacturing techniques and processes which has been lost in the last two decades. Our programs vary from one to two-year career certificates/programs which are developed to prepare manufacturing personnel for an entry to intermediate level position in the industry where medical, optical, electrical, chemical, dimensional, biomedical, and mechanical operations are performed. These certificate programs and degree program emphasize not only machining but manufacturing as a whole which includes (but is not limited to): Blueprint Reading; Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing; Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM); Computer Aided Design (CAD); dimensional metrology; precision laboratory procedures; mechanical part geometry; instrument calibration; and traceability. 

Several Community Colleges and some universities in California have machining and manufacturing curricula, and some offer degrees and certificates. Manufacturing concentrations may also be available as part of a four-year program at some CSU schools. The best known 4 year programs in California can be found at Cal Poly Pomona and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.  There are a number of local community colleges in Southern California that offer Machining and/or Manufacturing programs such as (but not limited to): Orange Coast College; Cerritos Community College; Santa Ana Community College; and El Camino Community College.

Through this tool, collaboration among the 9 community colleges, the North Orange Continuing Education, and 15 K12 school districts in Orange County will enable gains in the matriculation of CTE students from secondary to post-secondary. The tool identifies the CTE pathways in the Orange County high schools and aligns them to their community college pathway matches.","THESE NEEDS?
What is the issue? Presently, the manner and systems  whereby  graduating  high school students can determine how to continue their CTE pathway studies at the community college level is, with some exceptions, marginal at best. They,  their  parents and their counsellors are often poorly informed of the options available.   What does this tool do? The CTE Crosswalk Pathway Tool identifies all the CTE pathways in the Orange County high schools and aligns them to their possible  pathway matches in Orange County’s nine community colleges and North Orange Continuing Education. Who is developing this tool? The very first iteration of the crosswalk was developed in 2016 by the Centers of Excellence, the data technical assistance providers for the California Community College ‘Doing What Matters’ framework. At the request of the Community College Chancellor’s Office and Kathy Booth of WestEd, this effort was revitalized starting in January 2017. The OC Pathways and Orange County Dept. of Education, under the leadership of Amy Kaufman, Executive Director for OC Pathway accepted this challenge and tasked Steven Glyer, Consultant for Workforce Development to lead this effort. The OC Pathways and OCDE provided the funding for this phase of the project. Both the California Department of Education and the California Community College Chancellor’s Office are informed and supportive of this initiative. Since the basic crosswalk is now complete, the project is ready to enter Phase III, implementation. How is the  alignment done? In K12, CTE pathways are organized into 15 industry sectors such as Business & Finance or Marketing, Sales and Service. These are further broken down into 58 specific pathways such as Child Development, Animal Science or Game   Design and Integration. All CTE courses in a sequence at a school site are assigned  into a specific pathway. Each of these pathways is assigned a code number. For  example, the Game Design pathway is assigned Code 114. In the community colleges, they organize their CTE programs by TOP codes. TOP stands for Taxonomy of Programs. These are six-digit codes. The first two digits are like the 15 industry sectors in K12. They are broad, such as Information Technology or Health. The next four digits are similar to the K12 pathway codes. So for example, in TOP code 06 – Media and Communications, the four-digit TOP code 0602 is Journalism, 0604 is Radio and Television, etc. Are these exact matches? No. We believe that career development in the K12 world is foundational. This is where students are beginning to explore what they want to do with their lives. But knowing exactly what path they   will finally take occurs later in their education. It is in the college world that students dive deeper into careers. So the foundational high school pathway may have a variety of possible college pathways. Thus this crosswalk was designed to go from the   specific to the broad. For example, a student in the K12 pathway 196 – Biotechnology might consider continuing their career development into TOP Code 0403 – Biotechnology and Biomedical Tech or TOP Code 0934, Electronics (Biomedical Instrument) or TOP Code 1201 – Health Occupations, General. How did you decide what matched what? All of the K12 pathway codes have a program descriptor. This descriptor is a short one, two, or three paragraph description of what the career pathway matches. In the TOP Codes, the descriptors are not as extensive but do provide a good enough description to allow us to perform a match. How might this tool be used? For K12 districts to receive federal Perkins funding, all districts must identify and report their CTE programs by pathway codes. This is very useful, as all CTE courses must be placed into state standardized  buckets.  To  measure  the success of CTE programs, a system that is now included in all student information systems that identifies when a student completes two courses  in  a  pathway sequence. This is an important technical advancement, as it can be used to auto- generate a message to the student, his/her parents, counsellor and pathway teacher. How this message is delivered, whether it be paper or electronic, sent out via text message, is available on a smart-phone or home computer is all in development. In Orange County, all 15 districts with CTE programs use the Aeries Student Information System. Discussions have been held with Aeries about collaborating in using the Crosswalk tool with their system. Aeries views such a collaboration as a significant enhancement to their service and has agreed to engage in its development. How will the community college part of the tool be enhanced? As a student, parent or counsellor is informed of the possible opportunities for further education, what will  be shared with them has a broad range of possibilities. But almost all want to know  the answers to these eight key questions. 1. What are my career options? 2. What are the education paths to those options? 3. Where are these programs located in Orange County? 4. What will I need to take? 5. How long will it take? 6. How much will it cost? 7. How much financial aid can I get? 8. Will my credits transfer? We have also been in discussions with a developer of a smart-phone app called “Here to Career.” This is a joint effort of the Young Invincibles organization and the Foundation for the Community Colleges. The app was designed to give answers to some of these key questions but delivered in a way that today’s millennials respond to, social media. We see that their work may be closely connected to the Crosswalk alert system, which may make it capatable for combining the strengths of both efforts. Beyond this, we are confident that other strategies and collaborations will develop. There are other data and strategic planning tools beyond Here to Career in which the CTE Pathway Crosswalk tool might well integrate into. These might include such tools as MyPath, MyBestBets, California College Guidance Systems, Career Coach, etc. And finally, there is a tight alignment with the state and national Guided Pathways movement. These include the newly funded $150M Guided Pathways initiative of the Chancellor’s Office as well as the national effort of the AACC.

Work-based learning through job shadowing, volunteer opportunities and internships will provide students with professional experience necessary to succeed as EAs. Students who complete the Pathway will take the Special Enrollment Exam and be eligible for EA status.","Data available from OIEA show that 65% of students come to ELAC to get a job or advance their career. ELAC serves a dynamic low/moderate income population, and attending ELAC offers students the opportunity to increase their earning power by developing skills employers need.

Emsi data indicates there is a need for more tax preparation professionals in Los Angeles County. Table 3.1 of the Emsi East Los Angeles College Program Demand Gap Analysis shows an annual gap of 1,922 unfilled job opening in CIP 52.0302 Accounting Technology/Technician and Bookkeeping. The crosswalk between educational programs and occupations shows Tax Preparers (SOC 13-2082) as part of CIP 52.302. 

The Business Administration Department will create a Pathway to Enrolled Agent program to meet the needs of local employers and enable students to enter the workforce with unlimited earning potential. The Pathway requires the development of 2 new tax courses and revision to existing courses to provide student with the background needed to pass the IRS Special Enrollment Exam.  We will create a 19-unit, 6 course Enrolled Agent certificate program to provide students with the knowledge required to successfully complete the IRS Special Enrollment Exam. Courses to be included in the certificate include Accounting 1 (5 units), Accounting 15 (3 units), Accounting 16 (3 units), Accounting 19 (3 units), Law 1 (3 units) and an elective of new courses to be developed. 

Enrolled Agents are tax practitioners with an unlimited right to represent taxpayers before the administrative levels of the Internal Revenue Service, including appeals, collections and audits. Only Certified Public Accountants and Attorneys share the same unlimited right. Unlike CPAs and Attorneys, EAs are licensed by the federal government. As such, EAs can represent taxpayers from any state. There is no degree required to become an EA, and the wide variety of employment options make it an excellent professional designation for students seeking a rewarding career.

Work-based learning through job shadowing, volunteer opportunities and internships will provide students with professional experience necessary to succeed in the workforce. We will pursue partnerships with local tax preparation firms, accounting firms and non-profit agencies to provide Pathway students with valuable professional experience.

Enrolled Agent (EA) status is the highest credential awarded by the Department of the Treasury. Obtaining EA status significantly enhances the professional credibility of a tax practitioner. Changes to the tax code create consistent demand for skilled, competent tax professionals. EAs provide valuable service to businesses, individuals and the government. Creating the Pathway and the accompanying certificate will support ELAC’s commitment to prepare students to successfully complete workforce development programs.

Goal: develop a career pathway, augmented by an on-campus legal aid center where ELAC students gain skills and experience with program partners providing free legal services to students and the community.","ELAC is surrounded by low and moderate income communities and the student populations reflects those same demographics. The mission of the college is to “empower students to achieve their educational goals, to expand their individual potential, and to successfully pursue their aspirations for a better future for themselves, their community and the world.” Many students at ELAC are in pursuit of the skills and training necessary to earn a job in the near future. Through the college’s course offerings and student support services, many students have been able to advance from skills and knowledge building to attaining a job. While attaining a job is the next major step for many of the student’s, many face additional legal challenges and obstacles they must overcome.  Further many face immigration, housing, criminal, family or other civil legal barriers that make it difficult to achieve their full potential.  While overcoming these barriers, many do not have the resources to contemporaneously succeed academically and also travel in pursuit of opportunities to develop focused skills and obtain professional work experience in their chosen career pathway. For our students, there is more to securing long-term career employment than submitting a resume and waiting to be hired.

The motivation for this project arises from the need to assist students in obtaining the skills and experience necessary for accessing jobs in the legal industry, the need to provide legal assistance to students in overcoming barriers to academic and career success, the need to provide a degree and certificates to meet the demand of students, and finally the need to offer legal resources to students and local underserved communities.

The Job Market

According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data updated as of October 24, 2017, employment of paralegals and legal assistants is projected to grow 15 percent from 2016 to 2026, much faster than the average for all occupations. The median annual wage for paralegals and legal assistants was $49,500 in May 2016.   According to the California EDD Labor Market Index, the labor market in the Los Angeles region for Paralegals and Legal Assistants (23-2011) reflects 2024 projected employment of 8,920 up from 8,180 in 2014 adding 740 jobs reflecting 9.0% change (0.9% annually) with 254 total annual job openings, consisting of 74 new jobs and 180 replacement needs with median hourly wages of $27.91 and annual salaries of $58,049. The terms ""legal assistant"" and ""paralegal"" are used interchangeably, much like the terms attorney and lawyer.

According to an August 25, 2017 article from the American Bar Association, “In addition to private law firms, other organizations in the private sector employ paralegals. Some examples include corporate legal departments, insurance companies, estate and trust departments of large banks, hospitals and health care organizations, real estate and title insurance companies, and professional trade associations. Job opportunities in the public sector are available in community legal services programs, consumer organizations, offices of public defenders, prosecutors and attorneys general, city attorneys, a wide array of state and federal government agencies, and the judicial system.”

The hands-on experience, training, knowledge and skills acquired by working with the attorneys and legal professionals from ELAC-LAW partner legal services programs will prepare our students to fill positions related to field of study at a variety of organizations to meet the projected 15 percent growth in the labor market in the next ten years.

Skills and Experience Building

According to a May 20, 2016 article in the Journal of Kansas Bar Association, “Paralegal roles are expanding, and law firms are looking for multiple skills and a wide variety of experience when they hire paralegals. Paralegal educators agree that a combination of strong technology skills, writing and communication skills, and hands-on experience help paralegals find a job when they get ready to enter the workforce.”

The outcome is to enrolled 35 students per year and graduate a minimum of 30 students every two years.","The Pharmacy Technicians prepare medications under the direction of a pharmacist. They may measure, mix, count out, label, and record amounts and dosages of medications according to prescription orders. There are several needs that motivate this project. First, this project will increase the number of allied health programs that are being offered at ELAC.  Currently there are only three programs, which includes Health Occupation, Health Information Technology and Respiratory Therapy.  By expanding the Allied Health Department, this will allow the department and college enrollment to grow.  It will give the potential students and current students another occupation to consider when they are making their decision to attend ELAC and select their degree of study.

Another need that motivates this project is ELAC does not have many opportunities for students if they are not successful in Nursing, Respiratory Therapy or Health Information Technology.  ELAC needs to be able to offer the student another career pathway if they are not successful in the one they initially selected.

Pharmacy Technicians, in addition to being an occupation that is growing faster than average, are essential to the efficiency of the modern pharmacy. The dynamic nature of this occupation and industry is driven by the development of new pharmaceutical products and the competitiveness of the retail pharmacy environment. The changes caused by these factors along with the growing number of prescriptions filled each year, and the related demands for paperwork and accuracy, create a high-stress environment in the pharmacy. 

Pharmacy Technicians are seen as “pharmacist-extenders.” By taking on administrative and repetitive duties, the technician relieves the Pharmacist for his/her role as a patient counselor. Though many Pharmacy Technicians are trained in private proprietary programs, there is one public AA-degree and certificate program in Los Angeles County at Cerritos College. National efforts to upgrade the quality of Pharmacy Technicians and standardize their education and credentials favor programs like Cerritos’ that provide both practical training and a general education.

The Pharmacy Technician Program supports the Task Force Recommendation #3 Career Pathway.  This career pathway prepares students for jobs with the regional labor market.  The fourth need that motivates this project is according to O*Net, Physical Therapy Assistant occupation is expected to grow rapidly in the next several years and will have large numbers of job openings.  According to O*Net, this occupation is projected to grow much faster than average (employment increase of 14%) over the period of 2016-2026.  

However, according to the Occupational Outlook Handbook, the overall employment of pharmacy technician is projected to grow 12 percent from 2016 to 2026, much faster than the average for all occupations. Demand for pharmacy technician is expected to increase in response to the healthcare needs of an older population and individuals with chronic conditions, such as diabetes and obesity. The median annual wage for pharmacy technicians was $30,920 in May 2016.

This project will be able to support the mission of the Strong Workforce Project.  The Pharmacy Technology program will including, at a minimum, increase the number of students enrolled at ELAC, increase the number of degrees awarded, allow the graduate to obtain wage increases  after obtaining their credentials.

However, according to the Occupational Outlook Handbook, the overall employment of physical therapist assistants and aides is projected to grow 30 percent from 2016 to 2026, much faster than the average for all occupations. Demand for physical therapy is expected to increase in response to the healthcare needs of an older population and individuals with chronic conditions, such as diabetes and obesity. The median annual wage for physical therapist assistants was $56,610 in May 2016.

This project will be able to support the mission of the Strong Workforce Project.  The Physical Therapy Assistant program will including, at a minimum, increase the number of students enrolled at ELAC, increase the number of degrees awarded, allow the graduate to obtain wage increases  after obtaining their credentials.

The 2018 design-construction economic forecast looks positive as the VR architecture students will enter the job market in late 2018, early 2019. In the American Institute of Architects Economic forecast, they state, “Demand for design services picked up in October at architecture firms nationwide, and the American Institute for Architects says conditions look good for construction activity through 2018.
The Architecture Billings Index (ABI), a monthly reading of design activity, came in at 51.7 in October, up 2.6 points from September. Because it’s above 50, it represents an increase in billings from the previous month. A monthly score below 50 indicates a contraction in billings from the prior month.”

Augmented reality-assisted marketing and sales may use a number of technologies for the authoring, detection, recognition, and rendering of products. Once the products have been properly imputed, they can be displayed via mobile platform, properly equipped kiosks, desktop systems, and other stationary display types. User interface is likewise variable although most agree that touchscreen and the use of hand gestures to advance through catalogues and manipulate options is ideal.
The use of augmented reality in marketing and sales provides a variety of unique advantages for brands. Advantages like:
•Because all of a product’s features and varieties can be displayed via a digital device, retail establishments can keep a smaller showroom or storefront.
•Prospects and returning customers can evaluate and test products before they are released or otherwise made available in a given store or location.
•Customers can test our various size, color, and other choices prior to purchase. This assists them in making a more informed buying decision that ultimately improves their satisfaction with a product.
•Integrated social features allows customers to receive feedback from their or the brand’s network.

OC Center of Excellence Establish an Orange County COE to concentrate solely on working with OC colleges   on their various LMI needs, including TOP code alignment projects, gap analyses on emerging and/or priority sectors and occupations,  and  SWP  strategic planning.","OC Strong Workforce Regional Research Analyst As Orange County engages in additional projects in Round 2 of the Strong Workforce Program (SWP), it will be critical to gather data on how the various regional projects are impacting or moving the SWP metrics. Through the services of a regional SWP Regional Research Analyst, the region can benefit via the development of regular reporting on metrics, and ongoing recommendations based on regional statistical information; these regional statistical analysis and reports should inform not only current investments, but also future SWP investments. The Orange County region is set to receive close to $9M dollars annually through its Strong Workforce Program (SWP) regional allocation; these funds are distributed throughout the region via a regional planning process, where colleges submit regional projects that seek to address labor market needs in priority and emergent industry sectors. Unlike other sources of funding, SWP has some expected metrics, many of them aligned with WIOA, for which colleges are now responsible; these metrics include increased enrollment, student progress and completion, and employment. Selected regional projects must have an impact on the metrics (i.e. lead to increased enrollment), but it is difficult to quantify whether that impact can be attributed to a specific project; in addition, although regions are supposed to rely on the LaunchBoard system to collect outcome data, the system is  at least a year or two behind, thus it cannot be used to properly plan for future funding years. This issue or need can be addressed through the services provided by   a Regional Research Analyst, who could assist in collecting, analyzing and preparing statistical information from multiple research department throughout the region, which can then be used for decision making and proper planning; these information would be up-to-date and would validate some of  the  information  within LaunchBoard for the OC region. OC Center of Excellence The Orange County region used to have a Center of Excellence (COE) Director, who was assigned to work with OC colleges on workforce research studies, comprehensive labor market gap analysis studies, and other regional duties; the position was consolidated to just one director, instead of 2 for LA and 1 for OC, who is supposed to serve the 29 colleges in the region. Through the services of an OC COE, the region can benefit by having a dedicated person who can concentrate solely on working with OC colleges on their various LMI needs, including TOP code alignment projects, gap analysis on emerging and/or priority sectors and occupations, and SWP strategic regional and local  planning. The LAOCRC is the largest Regional Consortia, in terms of CTE FTEs, out of the seven Consortia in the state; the combined region is indeed a key driver in the Chancellor’s Office efforts of “More and Better” CTE; however, the Chancellor’s Office has recognized the region as two separate sub-regions, and thus the LAOCRC is the only Consortia in the state to submit separate SWP plans, one for LA and one for OC, which also involves separate budget allocations. The OC Region has to undergo yearly regional SWP planning, which requires having a dedicated Center of Excellence that can assist the region to properly and strategically plan where regional and local investments can have the greatest impact. In addition, while other regions similar in size to Orange County, such as the Inland Empire and San Diego, have dedicated COEs, the combined LA and OC regions have only one COE to serve both regions; as mentioned previously, the combined region use to have 3 dedicated COEs.",\n,\n,\n

Orange County needs to participate in the State effort but also develop and implement a plan that addresses the needs of the region. The follow projects are planned with the requested proceeds: 1. Regional and Statewide Marketing and Branding (Awareness and Outreach) - This project intends to participate with CCCCO in the “Projects-in-common” to take advantage of the resources being developed for the state. Additionally, the project will engage professional public relations/advertising services to develop and implement a long-term marketing strategy, provide regional marketing resources, support sustainable regional outreach,  and develop/promote community partnerships that support career education. ($1,338,000). 2. Story Mapping (Interest Development and Information Provision) – To support informed and inspired decision making in college planning and career exploration by students, parents, counselors and administrators, the Pathway Story Map project is utilizing geographic information system (GIS) tools to visually represent pathway options aligned with requirements for success in education and employment. Drawing upon digital media and multiple data sets including education program information, and employment and earnings data, the story map project provides a powerful learning environment that connects education to regional workforce needs and promotes social and economic mobility. ($300,000) 3. OC Career Café (Information Refinement and Contact Identification) – The region requires a web based “landing page” that will provide parents/students, counselors, industry partners, and other stakeholders career education resources and referrals to colleges’ counseling points of contact to facilitate student enrollment into regional programs. This resource will be developed in partnership with K-14 counselors, CTE faculty and administration, and will use technical experts and service providers. ($300,000) 4.

This network will be designed to promote: career exploration, employability skills attainment, employer engagement, work-based learning, and job placement opportunities to address Strong Workforce metrics.","What Needs Motivate the Project: The needs that motivate this project are not unique to the nine (9) Orange County colleges and the North Orange Continuing Education (NOCE) center (referred to subsequently as the 10 Orange County institutions). Due to past funding methods and accountability measures, most institutions have focused on student retention and completion of certificates while dedicating limited resources to provide students with the full pathway from education to the workforce. For example, all 10 Orange County institutions provide some level of career services to students, traditionally focused on providing career exploration and academic program information. An area that requires greater focus is in providing experiential learning tied directly to career pathways, development of employability skills, and job placement. In addition to the limited focus on the later stages of career pathways continua, artificial boundaries and silos based on each institutions’ service area, hinders greater access for students to employment opportunities throughout the county and employers’ access to a broader base of potential employees. This lack of regional coordination frustrates employers and ultimately causes them to disengage from partnering with community colleges. Due to the fact, each institution uses a different system and process for managing internship and job placements, employers have a difficult time finding and navigating multiple systems and are discouraged from listing their opportunities with colleges. Included below are the regional needs as identified by a workgroup that included colleges, adult education providers, employer representative groups and community partner agencies: • Student Needs: career, industry, and college exploration; ability to engage in work-based learning opportunities; job readiness (employability) skills; electronic portfolios that allow students to collect, organize, and highlight their skills and experiences; and access to employment opportunities throughout the Orange County region and not be limited to only those employers in a single school’s service area. • Employer Needs: ease of access to a centralized job board, ability to create multiple levels of relationships with faculty and programs whether it be one-to-one, one-to-many, or one-to-all (employer to make the decision); opportunities to create career awareness within an industry/business; ability to identify business/industry employees who might serve as faculty; ability to connect with multiple campuses without duplication of effort, incumbent training, mechanisms to present their company information (such as their company profile, types of jobs are available, and the different skills they are seeking from qualified candidates); the ability to host field trips and/or job shadowing/mentoring opportunities; and increased knowledge of the training programs offered at each of the institutions. • College Needs: student metrics and data reports; ability to identify business/industry employees who might serve as faculty; increased employer engagement; ease of access to regional opportunities and companies (platform and tool); the ability to help meet employer needs throughout the region and not be limited to only the service area when the need is greater than one school can provide; a system that honors long standing relationships if an employer decides they only want a one-to-one relationship; increased linkages and tracking capabilities to allow for tracking students from high school to college to employment; a platform that can assist with online vetting of companies to ensure that the job postings are from legitimate places of business; and professional development opportunities for integration of statewide tools, resources, and 21st century skills training/curriculum materials. • Regional Needs: the ability to utilize and access the strengths of all regional resources without duplicating efforts; ensure vertical alignment (Chambers, Workforce Development Boards, One-Stop Centers, Other Community Partners, K-12s, Colleges, Adult Education Centers, Adult Education Block Grant Consortia, Deputy Sector Navigators, and Universities); stronger employer engagement; student and employer-centric job placement services; the ability to provide additional resources to our students (such as childcare, tuition support, books, etc.); increased employment, internship, and work-based learning opportunities; alignment with all of the CCCCO’s supported tools and resources to ensure that regionally we are capitalizing on their benefits; identifying the gaps and assessing the needs within the region to increase the education-to-employment pathway; and identifying how we best serve all student populations (working adults, high school graduates, special populations, veterans, international students, alumni, and at-risk students). How Project will Address These Needs: The regional project is divided into three different sections: Foundational, Long-Term Sustainability, and Short-Term Pilot Projects. It is important that the region have a strong understanding of the current groundwork available and in use within the region. This base knowledge will allow the workgroup and partners to determine which new tools and resources would work best in creating a unified, regional platform, which will comprise the Foundational section of this project. While it is great to have the opportunity to apply for regional Strong Workforce funding to develop this regional project, the workgroup is cognizant that the development and adoption of a regional platform must be able to be maintained in the long-term and sustainable when/if Strong Workforce funding ends. With that in mind, we will becompetitive, short-term pilots of existing local partner efforts regarding employer engagement and/or job placement to test their ability to be scaled-up for used throughout the region and/or new pilots to determine how we best leverage services offered by our community partners while eliminating duplication of community college services. It is envisioned that both the long-term and short-term pilots will run in tandem with a Regional Work-Based Learning and Job Placement Steering Committee; comprised of the 10 Orange County institutions, regional community partners, K-12, and other state-wide initiative staff members; eventually deciding which pilot programs are most effective for long-term sustainability as part of the regional platform. Vision: All Orange County Community Colleges, students, community partners, and employers are engaged and working collaboratively on a seamless platform to meet the needs of job seekers, employers, and our region.
Mission: Develop an Orange County regional workforce development platform that will: 1. Promote student career exploration and employability skills attainment 2. Encourage employer engagement with students, faculty, and educational programs 3. Support student work-based learning and job placement opportunities Project Goals:
1. Develop a single point of access for all employers to reduce the barrier to finding qualified employees and increasing access to colleges, faculty, programs, and students 2. Create job/employability skills building opportunities for all students to ensure their success in finding and maintaining quality employment 3. Maximize access to work-based learning and employment opportunities for all students 4. Share relevant data collection and reporting information 5.

Promoting CAOT programs, collaborating with work-based learning organizations, hiring a part-time marketing strategist, academic coach, and an employment specialist leads to increased certificate completions–leading to opportunities in the open regional job market and closing the demand gap.","The CAOT Student Roadmap to Success Program is being developed to meet the demand of jobs for the local region of LA County. According to the Economic Overview and Program Demand Gap Analysis Report (EMSI), October 2017, and LMI data, the office and administrative support is fourth in the top industries job list in LA County. Secretaries/Administrative Assistants are the occupations with the most projected job openings of 71,782 jobs, followed by Customer Service Representatives at 63,169 jobs. Wages are appealing for entry-level workers at a median wage of $20.36. The number of jobs are projected to increase by an additional 25,000 by 2026. 

For Global Trades and Logistics (GTL) and International Business, the most growth over the next five years is expected to be for Customer Service Representatives (see figures above), International Sales Representatives/Associates, and Global Sourcing or Procurement Specialists/Coordinators. LMI data indicates 78,019 in jobs with a projected increase of 8,559 in the next five years for GTL. Wages are very appealing for entry-level workers at median hourly wage earnings of $26.03.

The CAOT Student Roadmap to Success program will also address the East Los Angeles College's economic overview and program demand gap analysis. According to the Economic Overview and Program Demand Gap Analysis (EMSI), October 2017, report for East Los Angeles College, a program demand gap between the number of certificate completions and job demands are considered significant or beyond normal labor market fluctuation when the gap is larger than 5,000. Administrative Assistant and Secretarial Science currently has a program demand gap of 5,653. 

In conclusion, the data confirms that there is a definite need and demand to support a program such as the CAOT Student Roadmap to Success. The program will guide students from start to finish to a successful pathway of learning new skills, academic achievement, and internship/job placement to meet today’s industries’ demands, and close the program demand gap.

": The Transportation Workforce Institute (TWI) at LATTC aims to ensure a well-trained and diverse transportation workforce. TWI’s reach is national – constructing and  disseminating  model,  sharable  curriculum  and  workforce development resources based on national industry standards and certifications. TWI’s impact is also regional – leading industry,education,  and  workforce  development partners in creating programs and services that  meet  immediate  and  long-term employer needs.","There are several, significant needs that provide this provides the motivation and rationale for this project. First, the region has an extensive, complex, and one of the largest transportation networks in the country and is a significant contributor to a robust economy and quality of life. The partnering colleges in this project are committed to ensuring the sector remains regionally competitive with the requisite, trained workforce. The industry (and it’s 10 subsectors) currently employs 194,387 individuals and is projected to employ an additional 8,825 individuals (for a total of 203,211) by 2020. There were 6,844 transportation establishments in the region in 2016 with occupations that pay, on average, family- sustaining wages (e.g. average earnings per job is $71,414). Furthermore, nearly 1/3rd of the workforce is eligible to retire within the next 5-10 years and significant job growth from replacement positions will transpire. In addition to transportation’s size and scope as an industry in-and-of itself, it intersects and supports other, significant industries that support the economic vitality of the region such as international trade. In summary, the industry has been and will continue to be a significant source of middle-skill occupations with economic-mobility potential. Second, Measure M is projected to infuse an estimated $120 billion into the region’s economy over four decades as the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) and other transportation agencies in the region build new highway projects, expand bus and rail lines, and expand operations. The projected employment figures provided above, do not include estimated employment growth due to Measure M. However, this project specifically seeks to supply the requisite middle-skill workforce to support the implementation of the measure which will be substantial. For example, a recent report by The Institute for Applied Economics of the Los Angeles Economic Development Corporation estimates that an additional 465,690 jobs (and specifically within the transportation and warehousing sector an additional 12,630 jobs) will be generated by the construction projects alone. Given the size and scope of the measure, and the fact that there hasn’t been another project of its size in our regions history, it requires a coordinated approach by multiple colleges across the region which is the intent of this project. And finally, this project seeks to address gaps in workforce development practices and infrastructure that is applicable beyond just the transportation industry/sector and community college programs of study. These gaps addressed by this project are: (a) the lack of integrated, coordinated, regional certificate and degree pathways where students can attend one or more colleges seamlessly and without incurring excess credits or time; (b) business and operational models that support the implementation and sustainability of regional pathways, and
(c)	establishing the infrastructure to support agile and interlinked responses to regional employer demands.

"The three (3) areas that we would like to address under our Pharmacy Technician Employment Readiness/Certifications strategy include: development and implementation of an in-patient simulation lab; and continue offering test prep courses that include the purchase of and access to the PTCB practice exams and certification vouchers.","In our self-study, one of the areas identified by faculty and students for improvement is insufficient academic support for students in the lab environment. This plan provides additional support for faculty to increase integration of academic support and career training within the lab environment.

Additional evidence to support this need is from our 2015-2016 Perkins Core Indicator report. The report states the following: There were 231 concentrators for academic year 2012-2013. The cohort consisted of students who passed three courses. 52.8 % of concentrators completed their Pharmacy Technician Certificate Program. The rate falls below the state target for completion for the Pharmacy Technician Certificate Program. It should be noted that ten students who started in the Pharmacy Technician Certificate Program ended up with either another CTE certificate, ESL academic success certificate or received a high school diploma from the School of Continuing Education. Of the concentrators, 90.2% of students who did not graduate completed seven or more classes. The students who did not complete the program struggled in classes Pharmaceutical Mathematics, Pharmacy Operations Lab, Out-Patient Lab and In-Patient Lab. In some cases, the students had to take the classes several times to pass or did not pass at all. 

Beyond providing students additional support through our I-BEST model, there are four main success factors that contribute to a Pharmacy Technician student’s ability to obtain employment after training which include: at least 180 hours of externship experience; smaller hands-on simulation labs; employability skills training (soft skills); and industry recognized Pharmacy Technician certifications.

NOCE will be meeting the employability skills training through classroom training and opportunities offered under our Strong Workforce – Workforce Preparation and Advancement Strategy. We will continue to offer workshops, one-on-one sessions, as well as house a workforce center.

"The three (3) areas that we would like to address under our Medical Assistant Employment Readiness/Certifications strategy include: development of and offering BLS CPR and First Aid certification courses; development and implementation of a simulation lab; and continue offering test prep courses that include the purchase of and access to NHA practice exams and certification vouchers.","All Medical Assistants must have a valid BLS/CPR and First Aid Certification for employment. This continues to be a barrier for our students to obtain since the certification can be anywhere from $60 to $120 depending on where students take the course. If NOCE were to add an apportionment generating certification course to the Medical Assistant certificate, this would create greater equity as well as ensure access to employment for all students completing the certificate program. A CDCP Noncredit course would allow all students access to required training. Strong Workforce funding would be used to pay all costs associated with aligning with the National Protection & Safety Consulting (NPSC) and American Heart Association (AHA) which include equipment, annual training site alignment fee, instructor training and monitoring until approved, as well as training site coordinator.

Another area that needs to be addressed and updated is access to externships and/or a simulation lab. During a recent statewide advisory meeting of all Medical Assistant faculty, it was discussed that students are unable to gain employment without having at least 96 hours of hands-on experience. NOCE recently began an externship program for students who have completed the Medical Assistant certificate program in partnership with AEBG. As encountered by many of our other college partners throughout the state, however, we are discovering many sites no longer accepting externship students. Many factors contribute to this including the fact that many offices and clinics are small and are unable to accommodate externship staffing as well as the high liability costs. Many schools are instead moving toward simulation labs so that students can still gain more advanced hands-on practice that provides a realistic and risk-free environment. The NOCE Simulation Lab would differ from our regular labs, because it would include practicum experiences gained in a medical clinic setting beyond learning the basic techniques. A simulation lab would include working with computerized equipment, supplies, and volunteers that simulate life-like scenarios. The simulation lab would be set up to help practice everything including both administrative and clinical experiences. Students would work at different stations and the simulation lab would operate just like a clinical site. This experience will help students not only be more comfortable, but also ensure they master the skills needed to successfully find employment. Many employers are now accepting simulation labs as an alternative to externship experience. Strong Workforce funding would be used to purchase simulation related equipment and supplies for this updated lab environment.

The final area addressed for employment readiness is certifications. During the 2012-2013 and 2013-2014 school year, NOCE received an Industry Driven Regional Collaboration grant to expand the capacity of our medical assistant program and increase student employment. As part of this grant funding, we were able to offer qualifying students vouchers to complete the National Healthcareer Association (NHA) Clinical Medical Assistant Certification exam. 2 

Approximately 90% of students completing the program took the certification exam. When that funding ended, NOCE continued to promote the certification exam, however, the rate dropped significantly and now there are approximately only 5-10% of students completing our program report taking this industry recognized certification exam.

Although certification is not currently required to work as a medical assistant, the regional medical assisting advisory group has identified it as a key success factor in students gaining employment. Additionally, discussions are occurring throughout the state to mandate certification soon for all healthcare workers.

To increase the number of graduating students who take and pass the certification exam, our full-time faculty member, began a partnership with the Orange County Healthcare Deputy Sector Navigator to offer NHA review classes. NOCE ran its first review class in fall 2015, which was attended by approximately 38% of our graduating class (35 of 92 students). It was reported by the faculty and CTE staff that many of the students completing the review course did not have the funds to take the certification exam. Additionally, approximately 30% of the students invited to take the free review course opted out due to the inability to pay the certification exam fees.

To increase access to and successful completion of the NHA certification exam, NOCE wants to continue to offer Medical Assistant Test Prep courses which will prepare the student for the NHA Certification Exam; development of a self-sustaining way to implement a review course for the NHA exam; and purchase NHA practice exams and certification vouchers.

Continued funding of this strategy would the percentage of students who take and pass industry recognized certification as well as students who are better qualified to obtain employment opportunities directly following completion of the Medical Assistant Certificate program. The metrics addresses with this strategy is increased employment, increased employment related to field of study, increase in industry recognized certifications, increase in wages, increase in enrollments, and increase in completions.

This included articulation of HS courses and offering dual enrollment courses under both AB 288 & non–AB 288 Agreements. However, available data show that fewer than 26% of the college career pathways are aligned with HS programs of study. At the HS, CTE lacks support and the focus has been on 4-year post-secondary education. HS staff has expressed frustration with trying to identify how college CTE courses offered at the HS can align with college Career Pathways. Over 300 high schools exist within the LA County region; creating a challenge with alignment. Currently, no dedicated staff exists at the colleges to provide this outreach.

San Antonio College (COE) with key local business leadership organizations including the Southern California Leadership Council (SCLC), the LA Area Chamber of Commerce (LA Chamber) and the Los Angeles Economic Development Corp (LAEDC). The Los Angeles/ Orange County regional economy, an almost one trillion dollar tapestry of industrial diversity, riches and opportunity amid wrenching poverty, is  being inexorably pulled into the information age, presenting more of its residents   with both the promise of economic success and the peril of being further left behind. The economic future we see today is quite different than the future we envisioned  only a few decades ago. In particular, we are in the midst of a structural transition where information technologies, artificial intelligence,  machine  learning,  virtual reality, and ever more powerful computers are changing the nature of work, the need for labor, the organization of firms, and the rewards that work now earns. Without direct and targeted intervention on our parts, as education, economic development and career technical education (CTE) purveyors, there will be neither enough middle skill, middle class jobs nor enough skilled human capital to sustain our regional economy. The region’s future economic success depends upon a stronger, better informed and more durable collaboration between regional workforce and education institutions and systems, industry firms and economic developers, who will each face an entirely new set and scale of challenges  which  will  demand  a  synergistic approach. Together we must confront the following challenges: 1) What are the economic, technological and globalization forces that  are  shaping  the  future industrial makeup and associated labor markets of the region? What are the implications of these future trends to middle skill  job  opportunities  and  allied training in the region? 2) How does the region ensure that more of its residents have the ability and accessibility to participate in the particular region’s future success and prosperity? What programs are needed to ease the transition for those who are at  risk of being left behind? 3) How does the region better prepare its local supply of labor for the innovation-intensive industries of tomorrow and more successfully connect this surplus supply of labor transitioning out of the region’s production-   based economy? Leveraging the aspirations and the resources of the Strong  Workforce Program, we can forge a powerful new regional partnership to confront these challenges.

The educational and training programs that exist in Southern California are extremely valuable because they provide paths to careers in construction for all skill levels. Universities and community colleges, as well as trade and technical schools, have developed targeted programs aimed at reducing the time spent by new entrants in on-the-job training to create an occupation-ready workforce.” Los Angeles region colleges have a signiicant portfolio of programs related to the energy market transformation, and a number of mechanical and electrical career pathways, many of which need to be upgraded to address emerging competencies in energy eficiency. This region offers an ideal platform to develop strategies, best practices, and evidence that can be replicated and scaled. The Sustainability Pathways project is informed by and has evolved through inputs from industry, policy makers, economic development agencies, faculty and Deans across the region. Colleges that are participating in this initiative offer programs in Process Control, HVACR, Environmental Technologies, Water/Wastewater, Building Automation, Architecture Engineering and Technical drafting technologies, Electronics and Systems Automation, Construction Crafts, Inspection, Welding Technologies, Construction Management and Data Analytics. Economic, public policy and labor market research are the primary drivers for this project: a) Annual demand for the target occupations in Los Angeles County is 5000+ versus~2,000 completers b) New competencies are needed in all target occupations to accommodate industry trends in Energy Eficiency statutory goals and new/retroitted building code compliance c) Technology is changing the way projects are managed, how materials are produced and the building process itself. The introduction of new technologies has helped to streamline, automate and speed up building design and construction d) Policies and incentives arising from California’s clean energy and pollution reduction mandates continue to accelerate industry’s evolution to automated solutions e) Clean Energy and Pollution Reduction Act of 2015. the Governor has called for a new set of objectives in clean energy, clean air, and pollution reduction for 2030 and beyond. 1) To increase from 33 percent to 50 percent, the procurement of our electricity from renewable sources. (2) To double the energy eficiency savings in electricity and natural gas of retail customers through energy eficiency and conservation. f) Existing Buildings Energy Eficiency Action Plan (EBEE Action Plan) in September 2015. The plan provides a 10-year roadmap to activate market forces and transform California’s existing residential, commercial, and public building stock into high-performing and energy- eficient buildings. g) Policies and incentives for adoption of energy eficient systems are at the core of California’s strategy for economic growth and competitiveness in the global market Legislation such as Proposition 39 and Title 24 (CA Building Code) continues to create new jobs by infusing hundreds of millions of dollars annually in energy eficient buildings and by incentivizing new private investments. New technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Direct Digital Control, Smart Sensors, Analytics, evolving HVACR and environment and control systems, Automated Building Controls, and Artiicial Intelligence dominate the way buildings and processes must respond to these drivers. In addition to the supply/demand and new worker competency gaps, multiple studies show a massive need to upskill the incumbent workforce. The foundation of the EC&U sustainability project is the “Expert Network” of willing and engaged cross-sector Faculty Champions that fosters a channel for industry driven competencies, common outcomes, stackable credentials and credit transportability across regional colleges.

": This project will capacity among the LA Region colleges’ noncredit Short-term Vocational programs. This will significantly contribute to the Strong Workforce Program’s purpose of producing a middle-skilled workforce. Community college noncredit programs are presently building operational infrastructure and/or programs within basic skills. Some colleges have very developed noncredit vocational programs, yet others are in need of support from colleagues with expertise in developing CTE programs.","One of the aims of SWP is to train individuals for middle-skilled employment in high demand fields. However, many students seeking training have basic skills deficiencies and other significant barriers. Census data indicates that 23% of adults in LA County lack a high school diploma, which demonstrates a potential for low levels of literacy and numeracy skills. In Los Angeles County, 57% of the population speaks a language other than English at home and 18% of the population’s income is below a living wage (the poverty line), so the flexible and open access nature of noncredit make it   possible to serve students from different socioeconomic, language, and educational backgrounds. In some cities within the Los Angeles Region, unemployment rates are  as high as 7-9%, which is about 2% higher than the County average. Moreover, individuals with some college or less earn lower annual wages than those with   degrees or certifications. As a result, students are not prepared for college CTE coursework. Based on the above data, it is evident that a high need population exists outside of the traditional student who enrolls in CTE programs. Recruiting these particular individuals into CTE pathways via noncredit will lead to more significant improvements in the regional economy. Noncredit is a viable option, and more importantly, courses are free to students and thus, provide access to individuals who may not otherwise have had the opportunity for free vocational training. This project can help students be ready for CTE credit coursework by first taking noncredit contextualized and pre-CTE courses and decreasing the skills gap. Examples of contextualized courses are Math for Health Careers, Reading and Writing for Business Careers, Vocational ESL for Welding, and Pre-CTE coursework tailored to a specific CTE discipline. Round 1 focused on developing these noncredit contextualized courses, but through the engagement with participating colleges, it brought to light that this project should not end with curriculum development. There was a need expressed by all participating colleges to continue this project in order to support   and develop noncredit CTE at all colleges in the LA Region. In addition, this project also addresses the need for a noncredit resources within the LA Region. Round 2 project will expand pathways to credit and work with pre-CTE and pre-  apprenticeship courses and programs. The following describes the activities of the  plan for Round 2, Years 1 and 2. 1) In order for colleges to develop noncredit vocational programs and CTE pathways, funds to hire noncredit adjunct faculty will   be provided to each college. The project faculty will identify CTE pathways to employment and credit CTE programs that are specific to each campus and also    meet regional labor demand. These faculty will write curriculum and certificates for their colleges. All participating faculty will be provided professional development to serve in this role by the faculty lead, who will originate from Mt. San Antonio College. There are also experienced noncredit faculty at other regional colleges such as West Los Angeles, Los Angeles Trade Tech, Glendale, Cerritos, Los Angeles City, Los Angeles Mission, and Citrus, who are excellent project resources. 2) This project will create noncredit pre-CTE coursework and certificates, and they will be mapped to credit pathways and work. Faculty from the 19 colleges will also include credit    faculty, some of whom are already connected to the noncredit Round 1 curriculum project. For example, noncredit courses and certificates are already being created in graphic design at Rio Hondo College even though this was not part of the Round 1 Workplan. These courses will focus on career exploration in the field and provide students with an introductory overview of the history, academic pathways, professional practices, and career paths of a specific industry. Long Beach City   College is using a similar structure in their automotive technology department. Upon completion of the courses, students will earn noncredit certificates and will be able    to enter into employment or a credit CTE program. Noncredit vocational faculty will be able to outreach to their credit colleagues to develop pathways. And at Mt. SAC, based on the North America’s Building Trades Union (NABTU), in Round 1, the faculty lead wrote pre-apprenticeship curriculum and program for the Construction Trades.
3)	An important activity is to identify discipline experts within each college to provide context for the noncredit coursework. This project seeks to build upon the pathway to priority occupations identified by the Center for Competitive workforce sectors. Based on extensive research conducted by the Round 1 faculty lead, it is evident that colleges are generally focused on developing programs that align with the sectors. These areas include health occupations, transportation, construction trades, and others. As previously mentioned, some of these experts, some being credit faculty, have emerged in Round 1 and are eager to support the development of the pathways for priority sectors. 4) One of the major activities in Round 2 will be to ensure that noncredit CTE readiness coursework and pre-CTE coursework developed in Round 1 can be implemented effectively. Therefore, coursework, teaching modules, and materials will be created and shared with LA/OC colleges. Participating colleges expressed that it was a major accomplishment to create the noncredit vocational coursework and programs. Preparing materials that meet the needs of noncredit students and adequately prepare them for college and work is beyond the capacity    of developing colleges due to the availability of noncredit faculty and in some cases existing expertise. Experienced noncredit faculty from participating colleges and the project lead will be the important resources for this part of the project. This activity will span both years of Round 2 and will require adequate faculty time. 5) A project activity is to develop webinars by noncredit faculty providing teaching strategies and use of materials for courses developed in this project. It is expected that within Year 2 of Round 2, all colleges will have offered noncredit CTE courses. Teaching demonstrations will help provide faculty with additional tools to offer these courses. They will support both credit and noncredit in offering effective and relevant instruction. Delivering noncredit instruction can be very different than credit instruction, even in the CTE disciplines. Noncredit students have endured tremendous barriers and are often lacking in both the academic and soft skills needed for college or work. These barriers include limited English and basic skills, no high school diploma, and numerous situational factors. This activity will occur Round 2, Year 2. 6) Professional development is a major activity taking place in both years of Round 2. It is planned for larger scale training such as IBEST, which is Washington’s Integrated Basic Education and Skills Training Program (I-BEST). The program is faculty designed and is intended to train faculty in contextualizing literacy, work, and college-readiness skills so students can transition into college or into living wage jobs faster. There is also a plan in Year 1 to request faculty from the State Academic Senate to conduct a training for regional faculty on developing curriculum and certificates, particularly in CTE. Other professional development will evolve as faculty needs emerge. 7) Ultimately, CTE courses developed within Round 1 and 2 will be taught at participating colleges. It is a goal of this project that every college will offer new CTE noncredit contextualized courses in English, math, and VESL. 8) Staffing for the project will include a Project Manager and Faculty Lead. The faculty lead will provide assistance to faculty colleagues, learn from existing faculty experts, and act as the liaison between the program manager and the faculty. The faculty lead will also facilitate training on curriculum and instruction. The Project Manager is of vital importance due to the scope of the project and the number of participating colleges. The Mt. SAC Continuing Education Dean and the current faculty lead have coordinated the Round 1 project. However, a dedicated manager to coordinate, organize, and create, in Year 1, a more structured and comprehensive timeline, is critically needed for the success of the program and to ensure the overall goal of building capacity for noncredit CTE in the LA/OC region. 8) Establishing, clarifying, and solidifying CTE pathways with our K-12 partners as part of this project must occur and is an important activity of this plan. There are various regional plans, including our local Workforce Development Boards and Adult Education Regional Plans that stipulate we are to engage our partners and create pathways. With the onset of Guided Pathways, this Workplan activity is timely and will be addressed in both years. It is expected that in collaboration with K-12 adult school partners, this project will develop a strategic plan to identify effective braiding of resources and to clarify and create more effective pathways to include our K-12 adult education partners, noncredit vocational programs, and credit CTE programs. Some activities of the strategic plan will be implemented in Year 2 of this Round. Existing best practices for collaboration with K-12 adult education partners will be noted and strongly considered

"This OC/LA County Regional project will create a regional NetLab Hub to develop and offer cybersecurity curriculum. To date, 12 LA college will collaborate  with Coastline College, where the region-wide NetLab Hub will be housed, bringing    the total number of colleges participating to 13. This regional consortium of colleges    will give students round-the-clock access to CTE training and virtual labs. The virtual     lab will be used for courses that prepare students for jobs in IT and cybers","This project addresses the need to create a cybersecurity program to expand the current workforce training within the Computer Information Technology departments at participating colleges. Just recently in September one of the biggest stories to hit the news was the Equifax breach in which an estimated 143 million U.S Consumers fell victim. For such reasons as this, Cybersecurity is one of the fastest growing career ields in the nation. It is estimated that there are currently 10,759 cybersecurity job openings in the LA-Long Beach-Anaheim area (source: cyberseek.org (a tool supported by the National Initiative for Cybersecuirty Education, a program of the National Institute of Statndards and Technology in the U.S. Department of Commerce)). Even if all the current cybersecurity academic programs were at capacity, it still would not be enough to meet the current industry demands. This program will concentrate on the training, education and preparation of entry and intermediate level technicians to secure a wide variety of computer-based programs and systems. This project will collaborate with other community colleges to further strengthen and enhance the regional NetLab Hub in preparing a viable and quality workforce for Southern California. Working with NetLab will ensure an eficient and effective use of pooled resources across the consortium on a continuous basis",\n,\n,\n
"Addressing California's severe teacher shortage has been a top priority in the CA Community Colleges. As we embark to align our education systems to develop pathways in high-demand STEM and CTE fields, we need to invest in  education and teacher preparation to prepare educators with the 21st century skills necessary to work in education careers. The overarching goal of the project is  develop a regional “Careers in Education” pathway(s) model with a particular focus on STEM and CTE.","The importance of growing a statewide network of STEM/CTE teacher education programs linked to Doing What MATTERS industry sectors in the LA region is vital to the success of the Strong Workforce Program initiative. Teacher Shortage: Labor Market Information and published reports indicate that there is a severe shortage of teachers across the state in high need areas such as STEM fields, and in Career and Technical Education (CTE). In a letter by LAEDC President & COO, David Flaks, in support of Senate Bill (SB) 436, a legislation that would help address the growing shortage of qualified science and math teachers, he noted that there will be a  projected shortage of 33,000 teachers in math and science that will not be met over the next decade. LMI data from the California Employment Development Department identified an estimated 51,500 openings for elementary school teachers and 31,100 jobs for secondary school teachers statewide between 2010 and 2020; with K-12 teaching being one of the top 10 best paid occupations and having the highest    number of job openings (82,600), second only to nursing (99,800). Growing Demand in CTE and CTE Shortage: The Bureau of Labor Statistics projected that the fastest growing careers would be in career and technical education (CTE) fields such as healthcare and trade and industrial occupations (2008- 2009 Occupational Outlook Handbook, Bureau of Labor Statistics). However, in order to prepare a workforce to fill these fast-growing and in-demand jobs, students will need training from quality secondary and postsecondary CTE teachers – resources that are severely lacking today. There is no accurate estimate of the shortfall of CTE teachers in California   due, in part, because districts haven’t been asked to include unfilled CTE positions in an annual fall teacher employment survey. However, several factors that are contributing to the worsening teacher shortage across the nation are also affecting CTE; the increased number of students enrolled in CTE courses resulting in more classes and demand for more teachers, the elimination of many existing teacher education programs, and the growing number of teacher retirements. In California,  this shortage is becoming a particularly dire issue as it faces high rates of retirement   in its current teaching workforce while the demand for more CTE teachers, given the influx of funding for career pathways across CA in recent years (e.g., CA Department of Education’s California Career Pathways Trust to create pathways bridging into college focused on work-based learning), has been growing. Importance of TPP programs in Community Colleges: Transcript studies on the institutions attended by the nation’s current classroom teachers suggest that more than 50% attended a community college for at least part of their education. Community colleges often provide the only technology training and most of the general content area courses future teachers receive. It is estimated that four out of 10 teachers complete some of their math and science courses at community colleges. Teacher Preparation Pipeline programs are critical to the development of career pathways throughout the  California Community Colleges. California teacher education can also benefit from   the diversity and faculty expertise of community college pathway programs, and from the alignment of K12, community college and university education pathways",\n,\n,\n
"The goal of this project is to develop an Entrepreneurial Mindset Across Disciplines in CTE fields, as well as STEM, that have the potential to yield business ownership, partnerships, and corporate entities. There is a gap in contextualized small business/entrepreneurship certificates and degrees and a lack of experiential learning by doing.","Today's students have come of age in a rapidly changing society where jobs are no longer guaranteed as the result of a college education, and where world politics have made a global society an undeniable fact of life. Technological advances are also instigating enormous changes in the social and nonprofit sectors. To cope with this new and unpredictable world, students are best prepared with the combination of a liberal or technical education and an entrepreneurial mindset who will be creative, adaptable, and able to think at higher levels of complexity. The driving force in this project is the promotion of self-empowerment, personal development, the value of team - all strengthened by one's role in planning and executing the entrepreneurial vision that meets the global needs of the twenty-first century. This broad-based academic discipline approach will serve as a preparation for life and career. The focus is to infuse small business and entrepreneurship concepts into all of the various career and technical education disciplines so that students will have both the needed technical skills and the needed business skills to succeed in the workforce and to become future entrepreneurial leaders. Examples of the need across disciplines is in career paths that lead to the nuts and bolts of operating a small business or becoming entrepreneurial: HEALTHCARE: a Home Health Aide becomes an independent sole proprietor, meeting the needs of patients CHILD DEVELOPMENT: A Child Development Specialist starts a Day Care Center operation ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE: a graduate uses his/her foundational training to become a Private Investigator with a small business operation CSIT: a student with stackable certificates in Support Services Technician starts his/her own business in troubleshooting computer issues for businesses ENGINEERINGa graduate takes his/her interest in architecture to become an engineering consultant in a new downtown building project ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION: A student with a certificate in Automotive Technology or Autobody Repair opens a their won repair shop CULINARY ARTS: A student open their won restaurant, catering business of food truck",\n,\n,\n

College curriculum approval processes have been established to ensure that rigorous, high quality curriculum is offered that meets the needs of students. Students are best served when curriculum approval processes are efficient and effective and when they ensure a focus on the quality and rigor of the curriculum. Accuracy and efficiency are critical components of this process. By law, the course outline of record (COR) is central to the curricular processes in the California community colleges and this is recorded in a curriculum management system. The course outline has both internal and external influences that impact all aspects of its content, from outcomes to teaching methodology, which, by extension, impact program development and program evaluation. Our current system is functional and been used for many years. However, it does not integrate with any other campus or state system. Course and program content must be re-entered in multiple systems and this leads to errors, inconsistencies, and confusion for students. The CTE areas are particularly impacted because they are legally required to review curriculum every two years and have many more data elements to provide.

"This project identifies and fills paid and unpaid work-based learning opportunities in high-priority regional employment sectors, contributes to positive permanent employment outcomes and retention through improved candidate preparation and training. 4CD will partner with Earn and Learn East Bay (ELEB) to accomplish these WBL goals. 4CD and respective colleges, CCC, DVC, and LMC will participate in supporting the work of ELEB, and will expand the use of the Salesforce platform and ELENA data","Significant investments for work based learning have been made utilizing Career Pathways Trust (CPT) grants. A network of employers, industry groups, educational partners and CBOs have created Earn and Learn East Bay (ELEB) as a way to scale work-based learning opportunities and match employer and education needs in one platform. This proposal is to continue the work started with ELEB for the purpose of perfecting the Salesforce platform that host employer and college data, fine tuning processes around its implementation, measuring its effectiveness, and monitoring its interface capabilities with what might be issued from the state such as LaunchPath. 

Work-based learning (WBL) is a strategy proven to increase employability and reduce the skills gap. Students participate in a series of activities interacting directly with employers to learn about career options, develop skills, and prepare to enter the workforce. Unfortunately, historically each institution, workforce development board, and community based organization have utilized different competing systems and processes for managing internships, on-the-job training and job placements; therefore, employers have a difficult time discovering and navigating multiple systems and are discouraged from listing their opportunities with colleges. Regional and subregional models for industry engagement still lack impact for students and do not meet employer demand for skilled workers. Additionally, methodologies for tracking WBL metrics, including the resulting job placement, retention, and career ladder advancement opportunities connected to WBL opportunities created through such efforts has historically been insufficient. 

This project addresses the need for more rapid and greater completion rates at the 4CD colleges through increased work-based learning (WBL) opportunities, and a single systematic way to develop and/or enhance a streamlined connections with industry. Earn & Learn East Bay (ELEB) is demonstrating strengths and has been expanding through initial work, showing value in enabling deeper employer engagement in work-based learning. 

Marketing materials and targeted communication will be provided to 4CD campuses on the benefits of WBL programs, demonstrating benefits for faculty and students. Streamlined access will be implemented. 

Through its customer relationship management (CRM) platform, ELENA, there is streamlined coordination of employer involvement in advisory boards; receiving and distributing employer pledges for work-based learning experiences; and better data collection and dashboard reporting of work-based learning experiences for LMC, DVC and CCC students. These activities and increased WBL metrics align with the needs of Strong Workforce, enable more employer engagement, support stronger coordination with K-14 pathways and provide better data on activities. Through this project, the ELENA CRM platform (run on Salesforce) will be expanded, additional users trained at participating colleges and technical assistance will be provided in mapping roles and responsibilities. Customized CRM dashboards will be created, and automated reports scheduled. Regular check-ins will be provided to identified key RJV participants with to assess progress and further desired services and CRM functionality.

"As one of the directives from our SCBC/VTEA Biotechnology industry board, we have been working on developing and implementing Quality Curriculum within our program. We are proposing to introduce a new course into the Biotechnology Curriculum, a course on Quality.  To implement this course into the curriculum, we will need to facilitate modifying the program description, certificate and degree offerings to include or create new degrees/programs that incorporate this curriculum.","This quality curriculum will allow students to sit for certification exam to become CQIA certified which is an industry directive for student education. It will also include incorporation of the Quality curriculum into our established outreach to high schools and the community regarding our biotechnology program as well as the industry.  No region 10 community college offers this Quality curriculum. This connects to our larger program goals of providing direct student education, resources and training for the industry.  This incorporates external certification of the student training which makes them more job ready and employable. In addition, it will incorporate this new curriculum into our existing programs of high school outreach with development, coordination, training, and support for the Amgen Biotechnology experience.  The Amgen Biotechnology Experience is an innovative science education program that empowers teachers to bring biotechnology to their classrooms.  ABE provides teacher professional development, curriculum materials, and research-grade equipment and supplies to regional high schools.  The coordination of the outreach and connection to the high schools has been a long standing focus of our program, keeping the curriculum current and industry relevant is required. The Life Sciences and Biotech Middle Skills Workforce report states ""Quality and the Certified Quality Improvement Associate 3rd party certification should be incorporated in every program.""  Our Biotechnology Industry board has emphasized the need for proper student training in Quality as it is embedded in all levels of Industry and the importance of student training in this curriculum will set our students apart.  This fits with Miramar College strategic goal I and IV by providing a biotechnology program that is responsive to change and fits the needs of our industry partners. Our Biotechnology program has set goals within program review to focus on relevant instruction for our students.  We are currently leveraging ISPIC state funding, VTEA funding, other grants funds and Southern California Biotechnology center funding to perform various tasks associated with these projects. This need was identified in the Life Sciences and Biotech Middle Skills Workforce report published September 2017 and a focus of our last two industry board meetings in the past year.

"The Child Development Program wants to evaluate, strengthen and revise the current pathway towards transfer degrees, permits and licensing requirements using regional and state models.  This will be completed by adjusting our courses and  modifying our certificates to be more systematic and ensures alignment from education to employment. The changes will be made to more closely align with the California State Permit for Child Development which leads to the attainment of livable wages.","The program is committed to preparing students by developing their skills and abilities to become early childhood educators who develop an effective skill set of best practice. In addition, our goal is focused on preparing students to be successful through offering quality experiences in a setting that supports their learning.  One of our program goals is to increase Awards Conferred: Certificates of Achievement: Associate Teacher, Teacher and Master Teacher; Degrees: AS Degree Child Development, AS Degree Child Development - Site Supervisor and AA Degree Human Development Studies. A continuing goal of the department is to empower our students to professions that lead them to a higher paying jobs by exploring options in the field of Child Development.  One way of addressing this is exposing them to different career paths through workshops and conferences.  We want to explore other possibilities such as ""Coffee Chats,"" visits to other Child Development programs and opportunities for community service and internships.  Developing a robust connection with industry leaders would be one of our goals for this project. We want to move towards all 6 priorities of the Miramar's Strategic Plan Goals:  Priority #1: To increase transfer volume and rate. Priority #2: To increase the number of Associate Degrees and Certificates awarded.  Priority #3: To increase the success rate for CTE students.  Priority #4: To increase the number of course sections to reach the goal of 10,000 FTES.  (Currently, we provide approximately 1/10 of our student population at Miramar.  In the last 5 years, we have doubled our number of students enrolled in Child Development).  Priority #5: To increase course completion rates for disproportionately impacted populations of students. Priority #6: To increase the number of outreach activities and programs.  Currently, there are State and regional goals in Child Development that will definitely be a guide as we plan and implement this project. The need to clarify the pathway comes from student feedback as well as counselor feedback that students are confused by the current system.  The Certificates of Achievements are not aligned with State permits and licensing regulations.  The current April 2018 Occupation Overview Emsi Q1 2018 Data Set shows an increase from 20,735 jobs in 2016 to 20,092 in 2017.  The need for early childhood professionals is growing.

"The proposal ensures adequate staffing and equipment requirements for the New Fire Technology Degree titled “Entry Level Firefighter” which begins in the Fall of 2018 & Fire Prevention Degree beginning Fall of 2019.","Both degrees align with State Fire Training and meet requirements for entry-level employment opportunities in the fire service and fire prevention. The degrees were developed at the direction of the Fire Technology Advisory Board to meet anticipated growth in the region and state due to increased challenges of service delivery and increased fire activity statewide. The goal is to hire (1) full-time Instructional Lab Technician 1. FTE and (2) part-time .5 x 2 = 1 FTE in addition to Personal Protective Equipment (Helmet, Gloves, Turnout Boots and Hoods for 80 additional students attending on campus Fire Academy option.) Provide lighting for increase in demand of evening classes. The vision for the Fire Technology Program is to provide an opportunity for ALL students regardless of life factors and economic hardships to have the opportunity to earn higher salaries working in the fire service or the growing fire prevention field. Traditionally, students wanting to be a Firefighter must attend a limited funded 16-week academy (No apportionment funding) resulting in the direct expense of nearly $5,000 to the student. The unintended consequence of this model results in discriminating against economically challenged students. This model is restrictive, since there are 24 openings in the regional academy annually. The new degree provides the industry standard entry-level required training to ALL students in the program. The Fire Prevention Degree allows students to earn the required State Fire Marshal classes including work experience through local Fire Prevention Bureaus. The new degrees and Certificate of Achievements have been the vision of the program for the last few years as State Fire Training aligned with national models for curriculum and licensure requirements for entry-level employment and new requirements for the growing Fire Prevention field. The work and efforts have been closely directed by the region's San Diego County Fire Chief's Association, Training officers, CA Fire Technology Director's Association and CAL Chiefs. State Fire Training and the Miramar Fire Technology Program have worked closely together to align the program to provide job skill requirements which could be embedded into the community college system maximizing funding sources, such as BRDS funding, Perkins funding and Strong Workforce, financial aid options and other funding to meet the growing demands for students to enter the workforce. California is faced with unprecedented fire activity due to a combination of several factors including continued drought, beetle bark infestation, global warming and other factors. Recent large fire activity in the last two decades has had a significant impact on the economy in addition to the safety and welfare of the residents. As a result, agencies have added staffing in fire prevention and firefighting at local, regionally, state and federal levels. Firefighting positions and job descriptions have been updated to meet a variety of potential emergencies and challenges facing public safety.

According the the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment of legal secretaries, the smallest occupation in this profile, is projected to decline 19 percent from 2016 to 2026. In legal firms, paralegals and legal assistants use technology that enables them to perform work previously done by legal secretaries, such as preparing and filing documents.The BLS shows employment of paralegals and legal assistants is projected to grow 15 percent from 2016 to 2026, much faster than the average for all occupations. Formally trained paralegals with strong computer and database management skills should have the best job prospects. By providing technical and computer based skills through a legal office assistant program early in their training, students can become employed faster and would have the resources and skills  to continue their education as a paralegal.

"This proposal entails the creation of a 40 unit Certification of Achievement and Associate in Science in Clinical Laboratory Science (CLS), which will include the four existing MLTT core courses and six practical internship rotation courses at a clinical laboratory affiliate (320-hour clinical Training courses).","Provide MLTT Program graduates who already hold a bachelor degree in science with a pathway to pursue a Clinical Laboratory Scientist licensure allowing for substantial economic mobility and at the same time, help offset the critical shortage of CLS professionals at the national, state, and local levels. This proposal entails the creation of a 40 unit Certification of Achievement and Associate in Science in Clinical Laboratory Science (CLS), which will include the four existing MLTT core courses and six practical internship rotation courses at a clinical laboratory affiliate (320-hour clinical Training courses).  In addition, this program will incentivize MLTT program graduates holding an AA degree to seek further education by attaining a bachelor degree and pursue the one-year training program. The existing MLTT program provides student with a certification allowing them to work in a clinical laboratory at a technician level able to perform test of low and medium complexity. A licensure in clinical laboratory science (CLS) will allow the graduate to perform high complexity level testing, hold supervisory roles, at the same time have access to better paying jobs, and help the industry fill job vacancies in this sector. This project will be a direct pathway from the existing MLTT certification of achievement program to a CLS degree to prepare Laboratory professionals allowed to performe high-complexity testing, employed by the Health Care Industry. Labor and Employment statistics demonstrate a significant need for CLS professionals at the national, state, and local levels. San Diego/Imperial County area counts with only Institution providing students with the one-year clinical training mandatory to achieve this degree (University California San Diego) with 10 to 11 training positions a year, which are filled by their own students. This program can align with segments of the EMT program. The MLTT Program Advisory Committee has suggested the creation of CLS program to help offset the critical shortage of CLS professionals. Nationally and statewide, there is a critical shortage of Clinical Laboratory Scientist (CLS) professionals to meet present and future labor market needs.  One of the main obstacles is the almost non-existent clinical laboratory facilities willing to provide the one-year training required for CLS students.  Complicating the problem, the average age for CLS professionals is approximately 46 years old who will be looking at retirement in the next 8 to 10 years.  Government Labor and employment statistics projects a rapidly growing rate of job openings (2016-2026) for CLS professionals of 19, 12, and 13 percent at the national, state, and local levels respectively. The program needs to upgrade equipment and instructional technology to align current course curricula to conform with accrediting and certifying agencies' standards and provide students with technological access to develop troubleshooting skills to simulate real laboratory circumstances. Technology software to closely monitor student skill development and achievement during internship.  Hire hourly employee to assist with clerical tasks to allow program director more release time for supervising matters and provide instructors with teaching and learning professional development to increase student attainment, retention and success.

Lastly, we would like to improve and enhance our website and other marketing strategies, and continue to update curriculum and the necessary equipment. Marketing strategies will be tailored to current professionals and high school students. Specifically, this will take a great deal of time and effort. This will aid in increasing student enrollment and continue to to give us a competitive advantage over brother-sister institutions. Our program aim is to continue to stay as technologically enhanced as possible to properly prepare our program's students to be job-ready and to obtain a competitive advantage by going through our Personal Training program. In addition, this proposal is related to our goals and student learning outcomes in all aspects. Specifically, it allows us to demonstrate effective skills and teaching strategies, and instruct safe and effective exercise sessions utilizing and practically applying personal training principles. Ultimately, as a program, we would like to be the most technologically advanced program in the local area, as it will enhance the quality of our program. This would be a nice compliment to our faculty of experts that currently work in our program and currently within the field of personal training. This project directly aligns with our vision and program review goals, established by our department chair. Other institutions, including Mesa College and all 4-year local insitutions, are currently purchasing technologically advanced equipment. Specifically, Mesa College recently spent over $50,000.00 on one item for their Personal Training Program. In addition, all other institutions, including SDSU, have current technological equipment we are presenting in this proposal. This will improve and expand the quality of our program, and ultimately, aid in student development and help us gain a competitive advantage. In order to also stay competitive with other public and private Personal Training Programs, it is essential that we continue to obtain the most advanced equipment. This is of extreme importance, as it will make our students ""job-ready"" as he or she enters the workforce, as this is the equipment he or she will be expected how to use. This is of great importance, as the Labor Market continues to increase in the personal training occupation, and these professionals will be needed in the future. This project is needed now, as we are currently lacking certain types of equipment. Currently, our equipment is outdated in comparison to other programs, which can have a negative impact on our overall program. Specifically, we have a diverse group of instructors, which has aided in our program's success. However, as other public and private programs offer experiences to their student body that properly prepares him or her to excel in the workplace, we have to do the same to maintain our competitive advantage. Specifically, this is especially related to City and Mesa College, and other 2-year programs, in which we are competing with on a normal basis. Labor market statistics displays an increase in PT jobs over the next eight years (2016-2026), as the outlook is faster than 10%.

Create a new Associate of Science in Public Administration to prepare students for transfer to a university in the Public Administration major. Create a new interdisciplinary Public Administration program that would encompass these three new awards and be housed in the Business Department.","Miramar is in a unique position to develop a new program aimed at civilian workers in the public sector. We have already have flourishing programs focused on specialized public sector fields (Administration of Justice, Fire Technology, Emergency Medical Technology, etc.). We also have a strong and growing business program. This proposal would capitalize on both of these strengths to create an interdisciplinary program aimed at educating students who are interested in public service with the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed to succeed in a public organization. It has been included as a goal in the Business Administration program review for the last three years. It has also been reviewed and is supported by the Administration of Justice Department, the Business Department, and the Business Department Advisory Committee. Currently no CCC degree program in San Diego County exists to prepare students for the plentiful non-sworn supervisory and technical positions within the public safety field.  In addition, due to the specific industry demands and rigorous selection process, a vast majority of students who are enrolled in the Administration of Justice program will not ultimately be hired in a sworn position, yet retain a strong interest in public service. This proposed interdisciplinary program will provide these students a pathway to achieve their career goal. It leverages the strengths, goals, and resources of both the Administration of Justice and Business departments. It will also support the statewide Open Educational Resources (OER) initiative and Miramar's Strategic Goals #1, #2, and #4. Student interest in this program appears to be high. An informal survey of Administration of Justice students conducted during fall 2015 indicated that about 80% would be interested in the proposed degree. In addition, there are a growing number of jobs available to civilian employees in the public sector. A recent broad survey conducted by the Center of Excellence, San Diego - Imperial Region found 106,517 federal, state, and local government jobs exist in San Diego County, with a projected growth of 4.2% over the next five years. A narrower study focusing only on civilian law enforcement workers found that 9,160 people are employed in this occupation in San Diego County, with 388 new positions expected to become available each year through 2022. Finally, no other CCC in Region 10 currently offers a CTE program in this TOP code.",\n,\n,\n
"We would like to enhance our yoga program and meet the current needs of the student population through the creation of a new program/track RYT-300 and the enhancement of our current RYT-200 yoga program. Specifically, this will be related to time and effort of faculty, facility development/expansion, equipment, certification costs, and other related variables.","First, we would like to enhance our yoga program and meet the current needs of the student population through the creation of a new program/track RYT-300 and the enhancement of our current RYT-200 yoga program. Specifically, this will be related to time and effort of faculty, facility development/expansion, equipment, certification costs, and other related variables. More specifically, our program will be completing the Yoga Alliance Application for registering our program under Registered Yoga Teacher (RYT) Alliance., which relates to curriculum development and strategy (including the opportunity to combine certifications to obtain an RYT-500).  In addition, we would like to improve marketing efforts, as our program is EXTREMELY cost-effective in comparison to other local programs and provides a better practical application experience. Lastly, we would like to create a different track, which is a certification that is considered RYT 300-hr. This would build credibility and respect in the yoga community, while increasing enrollment, success, completion, employment efforts, and allow students to enter profession looking to obtain professional income, instead of supplemental income. This would result in the opportunity for students to gain a profession that provides financial stability. One of the aims in our program, which supports our larger vision, is expanding our Yoga program and meeting the needs of the current student population and the community. This project is directly connected and supports these goals and objectives, listed in our program review. Specifically, providing funding for necessary materials and time-efforts is essential to supporting our vision and goals of expanding and improving the credibility of our current program and new program. More specifically, adding a new track/program (RYT-300) is directly related to our vision and goals, in which we would like to grow to offer more opportunities to students, while increasing enrollment, retention, success, and completion of current and potential students. We believe this can potentially aid in doubling our current yoga student enrollment. Improving and successfully completing certain aspects of our current program will aid in the development and success of the new potential track, RYT-300. This will build credibility and attract more individuals to consider and enroll in the current and new programs. Therefore, it will directly assist in development and success of this program, while helping us with a larger goal of expanding our program to meet current needs of our target audience and the current market. In addition, this project will aid in our current RYT-200 program, as it can be connected to obtain a high-paying and more credible certification. This will assist in the completion of both programs, as students will consider both programs, after the completion of one. First, Labor Market data displays the job outlook is faster than average. In addition, in order to provided RYT Certification, this project would be needed. Specifically, you have to be registered under the Yoga Alliance Inc. to be accredited nationwide. Also, offering a new track (RYT-300) brings more credibility to our program, as it allows students to further advance in the field of study, leading to higher rates of employment and job-ready ability. Lastly, our faculty and committee agree that this is need to improve student enrollment, retention, completion, and employment rates. To add more, labor market statistics also support the need for this project, as this the job outlook is at 10%. In addition, advisory committee recommendations align with the need for this project. Lastly, employers support the need as RYT-300 is more credible and the ability to obtain RYT-500 through the combination of RYT-200 and RYT-300, is even more attractable and employable. It allows students to become a yoga master, and obtain income that would be considered financially stable.",\n,\n,\n

a.	This project strengthens the academic and technical skills of students participating in primary training as well as students who receive in-service and continuing education, makes them better prepared for the job, and makes them better competitors in the job market. The EMC department have several criteria that need to be met in order for our students to get certified in this field. One of them is Oxygen Therapy. When Paramedics, EMT, First responders and other public safety responders show up to an emergency, one of the first things that gets check is vitals and how the patient is breathing. Oxygen is one of the first things that get administered to a patient in emergent needs and is a vital lifesaving tool.   Students have to learn the safety protocols as well as how to properly and safely administer Oxygen to their patients have to be able to practice and get certified in Oxygen therapy in order to pass their National registry Certification.
The EMC department goes through a lot of Oxygen. It can be filled off campus at a high cost to the JC.  If we have an Oxygen generator, we would have the ability to continuously fill oxygen bottles for training and practice.  We would also be able to extend its use to other departments at public safety thus affecting several disciplines and increasing training capabilities.   Having an Oxygen generator on the campus saves time and money by allowing us to fill bottles as needed and in a timely manner rather than having to travel with O2 tanks to an off campus facility paying for travel, time and labor of a 3rd party company.
b.	The link between career and technical education at the secondary and postsecondary level already existing through the department’s First Responder for High School Students’ program and the established articulation process will be strengthened.  Students at the secondary and postsecondary level will benefit.  
c.	Students are expected to gain competency in the evaluation processes and the use of other electronic data management.  Students will learn what the current expectation is regarding testing and will benefit from an expanded educational environment that the internet can provide.  
d.	This technology expands the existing scope of what is currently in place in the classroom/laboratory making it usable, reliable, and in keeping with industry standard.  It greatly improves the function of existing training methods.  It also better prepares program graduates for the existing competency verification methods.

"This project has two objectives; provide acoustic isolation treatment for the Petaluma Recording Studio so that students can complete the Digital Media: Audio Certificate, and to build a bridge between the local high school digital media programs and SRJC Petaluma.  SRJC’s Petaluma’s Jump Start team has established strong partnerships with 6 local high schools with CTE pathways for digital media. Their outreach work helps students transition into college level work.","The acoustic isolation treatment for the recording studio will better prepare the students for jobs by allowing them (a) to have the real-word experience of recording instruments in isolation, (b) to have the real-world experience of having site lines of communication with the musicians via a window to practice direction techniques, and (c) to create high quality recordings that can be submitted as a portfolio.  Without this acoustic treatment and a communication window; the students will not be able to record instruments in isolation which is the industry standard for recording studios, the students will not learn how to communicate with artists, view the effects of mic placement or troubleshoot issues visually without interrupting a recording, they will not hear the effects of their recording techniques due to sound interference between the walls, and recordings will be affected by interfering sounds from nearby rooms.

The rationale for bringing digital media high school students to campus is that we offer top of the line Digital Media education at Community College prices—we think students just need to see our program to get a sense of what an outstanding opportunity it is.  We have implemented these high school visits already with 17/18 SWP and would like to continue this good work.

"This proposal will help the program to enhance instruction and provide needed staffing support for the two Techniques, Training, and Practice classes. Students will learn from advanced industry special experts as guest lecturers and from program faculty with enhanced, current knowledge, skills, and abilities in teaching yoga. Second, paid teaching assistants for the KINES 70 and KINES 71 Techniques Training and Practice I and II courses will improve instructional quality.","The needs motivating this project are 1) high enrollment numbers in the program and 2) faculty support. Our 30:1 student-to-faculty ratio is not sufficient to deliver the level of instruction students need to develop their yoga practice and teaching. In the industry a ratio of 20:1 is very high, and private sector programs often cap their enrollments at 12. Our students will benefit from the support of paid assistants who can provide individual support as needed while faculty instruct the group.

An additional challenge to providing top-level instruction is the difficulty in finding instructors who meet the minimum qualification requirements of having a master’s in Kinesiology and a Yoga Alliance 200-hour (or above) credential. It is very rare to find professionals with this combination, as an extensive Bay Area-wide search in 2017 to staff program classes resulted in 0 candidates who met minimum qualifications.  Yoga expertise develops over years of practice, our few faculty who meet these minimum qualifications are still actively studying and practicing.

"Proposal is to increase enrollments and outcomes in Electronics Technology and Engineering Design Technology Departments, and to develop a guided pathway from high school to college to industry in the fields of CNC Machining and Product Design.  This pathway will provide trained employees for Greater Sacramento manufacturers and employers.","     Mass customization and rapid technology advances have required Greater Sacramento manufacturers to demand workers with more advanced skills such as using software to design three-dimensional parts, developing and testing prototypes, operating and maintaining computerized machinery and tools, and performing complex tasks and calculations to improve manufacturing processes. Sacramento City College's Advanced Manufacturing Pathway project will prepare students from high school to community college with skills in CNC machine operation, technical design and drafting, and product design.
    SCC will offer an first year certificate in CNC Machine Operation. This certificate can be offered at a local high school through an articulation agreement or at the SCC campus.  Upon completion the student would be able to enter the workforce and/or continue on with their education.  
   SCC will offer a second year certificate in Product Design. and Prototyping.  This will also include design thinking, and CAD courses.  At the end of this certificate the student would have the option of employment and/or transferring to a four year institution.
   With both of these certificates the student also has the option of obtaining an A.S. Degree.  Both of these certificates are very project-based, with projects coming from local employers, offering an opportunity for student interaction with potentiala employers and real-world exposure to work.
SCC has developed a strong relationship with a newly formed, industry lead organization called Sacramento Valley Manufacturers Initiative.  We are currently working closely with this organization, and will e working with the Education Subcommittee in the development of the curriculum, in identifying internship opportunities, and real world projects from the field that students could work on in the classrooms.  This organization has offered to provide field trips and exploration opportunities for our students.
    Ultimately these programs will create a regional sourcing pipeline for a manufacturing sector.
Advantages of SCC project:
- Product Design certificate is not offered by other regional colleges and avoids duplication.  CNC Machining certificate allows SCC, with other regional colleges, to fill a large employer demand.
- Encourages articulation agreements with universities which already have mature programs in advanced manufacturing and engineering
-Avoids local duplication of effort
-Enables SCC to offer manufacturing pathway - conceptual, practical and technological - despite space and resources limitations.
- Solidifies engagement with local industry employers through consultation regarding curriculum, through internship, and relevant project based work.

"This plan continues the work of developing the concept of and identifying space for the McClellan Innovation Center, which has potential to increase ARC's capacity to enroll students in Advanced Manufacturing and Advanced Transportation programs.  Once fully operational, we expect to serve at least 500 additional students per year through the programs at the McClellan Center. The ARC Workforce team will employ a variety of recruitment and outreach efforts to generate this enrollment.","Student enrollment in the Los Rios Community College District has been declining by as much as 3% over the past three years.  At the same time, regional employers have expressed difficulty identifying the skilled labor force needed to fill critical positions.  Finally, facility limitations at both offsite locations and the Main campus have stifled the College’s ability to respond to industry needs even when training opportunities present themselves.  
The strategic interests of the Advanced Manufacturing & Advanced Transportation@ McClellan Park Innovation and Training Center are to increase enrollment, target training for regional employer needs, and respond to industry training needs.  
Advanced Manufacturing can apply to nearly every successful, competitive manufacturer. Any production-based business that is progressive, uses new materials, or pioneers new processes and innovative technologies is considered part of the advanced manufacturing industry sector. Typically, advanced manufacturing includes aerospace, chemical, computers, electronics, plastic products, food, transportation, and machinery manufacturing—which are generally the industry sectors that readily adopt and apply new technologies. 
Through the outreach conducted while developing the North Far North Regional Plan, employers expressed the following facts and opinions :
•	There are many openings for CNC positions that need to be filled. 
•	Need more mechatronic program/certificates in the region. 
•	Would like to see more manufacturing fundamentals, such as electricians training. 
•	Industry-recognized certifications are often preferred over degrees

Advanced transportation often refers to the use of alternative fuel vehicles. These vehicles can be hybrid or electric vehicles or they can run on alternative fuels, such as compressed natural gas or hydrogen. They incorporate a variety of technologies to improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions and are constantly evolving. Examples of alternative fuel technologies include electric batteries, plug-in hybrids, hydrogen fuel cells and hydrogen internal combustion engines . 
One factor contributing to the expansion of alternative transportation has to do with increased awareness and demand from consumers, employers and legislators. Demand for alternative fuel vehicles has been steadily rising as consumers seek new ways to cut transportation costs and reduce their impact on the environment. Businesses anticipating increased consumer demand have been repositioning themselves to meet that need .
Through local funds, ARC proposes the following:
Need #1: Increase enrollment
Through the acquisition of approximately 80,000 square feet in instructional space at McClellan Park, we will increase the college’s capacity to enroll students in the college’s Advanced Manufacturing and Advanced Transportation programs (Diesel, Auto Collision, Welding, Design Technology, and Carpentry Pre-Apprenticeship programs, and eventually Drone Technology).  Once fully operational, we expect to serve at least 500 additional students per year through the programs at the McClellan Center.  The ARC Workforce team will employ a variety of recruitment and outreach efforts to generate this enrollment, including: 1) leveraging the college’s Local Share funds and Pathways resources, and Carl D. Perkins funds; 2) coordinating efforts with the college’s Student Services programs; 3) strengthening or expanding partnerships with employers in Advanced Manufacturing/Advanced Transportation, as well as regional industry associations; and 4) expanding partnerships with local workforce agencies (e.g. Sacramento Employment and Training Agency), County offices of education, and adult education providers.
Need #2: Training for regional employer needs
The McClellan Innovation Center is currently being designed as a flexible learning space that can be customized for different training needs. Classroom and lab space will be outfitted with a diversity of technologies and tools that support learning in Advanced Manufacturing.  These features of the McClellan Innovation Center will allow us to serve employers in new ways.  For example, employers will be able to contract with the college to provide specialized instruction, rent facilities for their own purposes (e.g. R & D), and/or collaborate directly with faculty and their students on innovative projects, e.g. in the way that the college’s existing Design Hub (maker space) serves employers.
Need #3: Respond to industry needs
Through the McClellan Innovation Center’s state-of-the-art facilities, and the expanded training capabilities it brings, we will increase the region’s ability to meet the needs of industry and prepare students and workers for jobs and careers in the growing Advanced Manufacturing sector.  Moreover, it is our hope that the cross-pollination of ideas and the synergy that will occur in this creative and flexible environment between employer and industry professionals, faculty, and students establishes the Center as a well-regarded regional institution, which further helps attract advanced manufacturing companies to the region.

Through the acquisition of approximately 80,000 square feet in instructional space at McClellan Park, we will increase the college’s capacity to enroll students in the college’s Advanced Manufacturing and Advanced Transportation programs (Diesel, Auto Collision, Welding, Design Technology, and Carpentry Pre-Apprenticeship programs, and eventually Drone Technology).

"This proposal involves three key activities designed to increase the number of students who enroll in Design Technology programs and increase the number of students that are prepared for employment through participation in internships: offering internships through the Design Hub, a project established through the CCC Maker grant program; offering dual enrollment courses at feeder high schools; and enhancing Design Tech curriculum with new material related to drone technology applications.","The ability to provide a well trained and skilled workforce to our industry partners has been identified as a critical need in our area.  At this time, the demand for skilled entry level workers outstrips our graduating class (Link to job recruitment postings by our partners,  Link to area job posting data based on keyword searches ), and as such, our program must demonstrate our capability to enroll and place more students.	  
 
We have identified San Juan High School as an ideal Dual Ed Pathway candidate because they have a strong program that integrates 3D printing and Laser Cutting with Inventor and AutoCAD design work. Their program provides ideal preparation for entry into Design Technology at ARC.  By providing 2 courses of Dual Ed, and then by providing a summer course for a third class, an entire semester may be completed before entry into ARC as a full time student.  This will allow 2-3 semesters of classes (depending on load) in order to receive our certificate in Design Technology.  With this certificate, students are currently interviewing and being hired for 2D drafting positions in Civil, Traffic, Cell Phone Tower, and Sanitation Companies. 
 
In addition to the strong program that already exists at San Juan High School, the instructor for the target courses is also an adjunct professor in our department.  This efficiency smoothes some of the integration difficulties of implementing Dual Ed.

?	These two dual ed courses (DESGN 100 for Juniors, DESGN 320 for Seniors) will be taught in the fall semester.  This is equivalent to .66 FTE for Fall and 0 FTE for the Spring. 

San Juan High School has a large population of low income students from underserved populations. This pathway is intended to directly influence their ability to enter our program as well to prepare students who will have a high chance to achieve completion of our certificate in two years or less (for full time students) and obtain living wage employment ($30K/yr plus benefits starting salaries)

"Past, present, and future success of the ARC HM program is founded in the high quality education available to the students by working with well qualified, dedicated, and caring faculty and staff.  The hands on operations run by students make the program unique as well as highly successful. This success requires significant student support. This project will continue to support a full-time Culinary Arts Supervisor and increasing a 60% IA to a full-time IA.","This project is motivated by the desire to see students succeed and become prepared for the workforce. It is directly in line with the strong workforce desire for “more and better.” This is the better component. This will provide students in the culinary program daily direct feedback allowing them to more quickly improve their skills and ensure their work is up to industry standard. 

This project will result in increased  persistence, increase in the number of degrees and certificates awarded, and most importantly will help meet the economic employment needs of the region, and result in higher wages for those who complete our programs because they will have attained higher level skills. 

The LMI data provided shows an unmet need of over 1,300 open positions, specific to foodservice and not taking into account the additional opportunities within the hotel market.

The scope of this plan not only meets each of the primary objectives for strong workforce: 
•	Improve persistence and completion rates
•	Improve quality of courses
But also meets the Task Force Recommendation of:
1.	Broaden and enhance career exploration and planning, work-based learning opportunities, and other supports for students.
2.	Improve CTE student progress and outcomes.

Additionally, this plan is supported by both the departmental EMP and Program Review which was completed last year. The strong workforce support will allow this program to move forward with the investment that has prevented it from coming to fruition, and is desperately needed. 

Please note: the previously funded Culinary Arts Supervisor position (Culinary Arts and Hospitality Management Expanded Success Program) does not fill the need addressed in this request. This request will in fact help to ensure the success of the Culinary Arts and Hospitality Management Expanded Success Program by fully providing the Supervisor the staffing level necessary to be successful. 

The three primary groups of disproportionately impacted students within the HM program are African American Males, Hispanic Males, and displaced homemakers. African Americans currently represent 14% of the student population, and Hispanics 21%. Each group currently has a success rate higher within the department that the college in general, but still has room for improvement. This position is a high contact position, working with students all day every day. This direct contact allows the IA to correct, encourage, and support students as they are preparing to enter the work force. Three additional hours each day ensures that students have support to the conclusion of their daily work. Without this, students will be left unsupported for three hours per day. 

Data clearly supports that immediate and constant feedback supports both learning, achievement and an individual’s desire to continue. Disproportionally impacted students are less likely to seek additional help than many traditional students. This request will ensure that students receive complete feedback each day, rather than feedback only on the first 60% of their day, before tasks are completed.",\n,\n,\n
"The ARC Design Hub leverages student skill and abilities learned in their program of choice and provides technical support to ARC faculty innovation projects. Strengthening this process via new equipment and through funding of student internships will provide real world work experience to our students while allowing them to apply the skills and abilities that they have learned in the classroom.","The ability to provide a well-trained and skilled workforce to our industry partners has been identified as a critical need in our area.  At this time, the demand for skilled entry level workers outstrips our graduating class (Link to job recruitment postings by our partners, Link to area job posting data based on keyword searches), and as such, our program must demonstrate our capability to enroll and place more students. We have identified that a work experience component is critical to meeting this need.  Although our traditional course delivery methods in Design Technology provides a strong technical education, it lacks a systematic component to provide a work environment for students to practice their technical skills and their workplace skills (soft skills) in preparation for successful entrance into the workforce.  As a pilot program, the Design Tech Lab had previously shown that ARC has the necessary student, faculty, and community critical mass to succeed in meeting this objective through collaborative work based on campus and in support of college and faculty needs for innovation. Moving past the pilot stage, the DTL became the Design Hub with expanded capabilities and an expanded breadth of collaborative departments in order to test the sustainability of this type of program.  It is currently in its second semester of operation and appears to be successfully meeting many of the criteria that will demonstrate enrollment growth and sustainability. For example, students enrolled in DESGN 298/498 work experience as part of their internship has grown from 24 to over 60 within just two semesters.  We continue to get additional interest as more faculty promote this experience to their students. It is the belief of the Design Hub core group that this number is limited solely by our space, access hours, oversight, and equipment limits.  Of course, the Design Hub is fairly new and currently has limited resources and space allocations.  At this time, it is not integrated into our planning cycle and it can only operate with continued funding through sources such as CCC Maker, Perkins, and Strong Workforce.  Footprint, equipment upgrades, and especially paid internships (student help) along with the funds to provide for faculty mentorship will ensure the needed time that we believe will allow the Design Hub to fully develop its system as a widely available, sustainable, useful, collaborative, and innovative part of our ARC Community and one which will provide a flexible path for growth of the DESGN department (as well as others).
 
To meet this need, the Design Hub plans to address the following categories of improvement: Equipment: 
?	Adv Mfg 
?	Laser Cutters, 3D printers (replace worn out units), CNC Routers, CNC Lathe 
?	Computing 
?	High capacity computing system with cloud data storage capabilities Software: 
?	Advanced 3D Modeling 
?	Advanced Coding 
?	Advanced Graphics 
Human Resources 
?	Paid Student Interns (Student Help) 
?	Faculty Project Oversight (ESAs for faculty project oversight) 
?	Temporary Classified Student Program Assistants (Similar to MESA)

With access to paid internships, students with economic hardship or without the support of college educated family are able to take advantage of the valuable work experience provided by the Design Hub. It also provides initial training for students who may have neither the experience nor the support systems in place to develop job and job search skills.",\n,\n,\n
"This project is designed for the Affordable Learning Materials Project Director to work with CTE faculty in identified programs to locate appropriate learning materials in both OER (basically no-cost) and low-cost materials.  The Director would then work with the CTE faculty members and other staff, such as instructional designers, to adapt and modify the identified materials to fit the needs of the CTE curriculum at ARC.","High textbook costs continue to deter students at ARC from purchasing assigned materials for classes, despite the fact that lack of such materials is injurious to successful completion of the course. As noted in several national surveys conducted by the Public Interest Research Group (PIRG) in 2014 and 2016, students are forced to forego assigned textbooks—which are an essential aid in learning new material, completing assignments, and studying for exams—because they are too expensive, and are knowingly accepting the risk of a lower grade to avoid paying for the textbook. With this program, ARC seeks to boost college access and completion, particularly for underserved students, by engaging faculty and others in the replacement of proprietary/commercial textbooks with more affordable learning materials, both no-cost, primarily with the use of open education resources (OER), and low-cost materials.
Students who had foregone purchasing a textbook were concerned that doing so would hurt their grade in a course. More than half of the students felt significant concern for their grade. It is concerning that students are forced to forego assigned textbooks–which are an essential aid in learning new material, completing assignments, and studying for exams–because they are too expensive. This also means that students are not only choosing not to purchase the materials they are assigned by their professor, but they are knowingly accepting the risk of a lower grade to avoid paying for the textbook.
Over the last decade, the price of college textbooks has soared. Since 2006, the cost of a college textbook increased by 73% over four times the rate of inflation. Today, individual textbooks often cost over $200, sometimes as high as $400. As a result, ARC students are feeling the pinch: they can either purchase the necessary textbook and add to their financial hardship, take time away from studying to work extra hours, or go without the book and accept the consequences.
Awareness of more affordable learning materials, especially OER, among U.S. higher education teaching faculty has improved, but still remains less than a majority, according to a new report from the Babson Survey Research Group (Opening the Textbook: Open Educational Resources in U.S. Higher Education, 2015-16). Survey results, using responses of over 3,000 faculty, show that OER status is not a driving force in the selection of educational materials–with the most cited barrier being the effort required to find and evaluate such materials. While use of OER is low overall, it is somewhat higher among large enrollment introductory-level courses.  
Faculty awareness of OER has increased, with 25% of faculty reporting that they were “Aware” or “Very Aware” of open educational resources, up from 20% last year. The most common factor cited by faculty when selecting educational resources was the cost to the students. After cost, the next most common was the comprehensiveness of the resource, followed by how easy it was to locate.

Disproportionately impacted students will have access to the textbooks (and other learning materials) from the first day of class.  There will also be less cost of college attendance with a decrease in the estimated $1200 annual cost of textbooks.",\n,\n,\n

"Counselors dedicated to the Tech Ed Division: Having a specialist counselor(s) who give consistent advice is a foundational element of guided pathways, and having those counselors readily available for our students will improve persistence and completion journeys
Celebrate Career Education! Event: Anticipating even greater participation and continued improvement in the CTE Outcome Survey participation and results.","Counselors in Tech Ed
The Technical Education division includes Automotive Technology, Design Technology, Electronics Technology, Horticulture, and Welding Technology programs on the main ARC campus, Automotive Collision Technology and Diesel/Clean Diesel Technology at a Mather site, and Pre-Apprenticeship and Electrician Trainee programs at a Twin Rivers site. These are distinct, complex programs with generally strong employer demand. Few (8%) of our students are enrolled full time.

With Strong Workforce funding available in Summer 2017, the division introduced resident counselors to the Technical Education area, housing them in the Tech Ed faculty office building. The initial funding was for one full-time and two adjunct counselors, the equivalent of 2.0 FTE. Benefiting from lessons learned as the program rolled out, the plan changed to two adjuncts in Spring 2018. The process for scheduling counseling appointments for Tech Ed students improved dramatically in the spring as the Tech Ed staff adapted, and there was a noticeable spike in appointments after the dean visited nearly every class scheduled and talked to the students about the counselors being available. Student contact hours are on a trajectory to double in Spring 2018 semester from those recorded in Fall 2017, an excellent indicator of the value of this program.

Having counselors who both understand Technical Education students and support the value of career education works. In addition, as ARC moves rapidly toward guided pathways for all students, continuing to have Tech Ed model the success of this type of support is essential for the college. Having one full-time counselor permanently dedicated to the Technical Education, division would continue improvement of the program by allowing more outreach to our offsite programs, including Dual Enrollment programs at our feeder high schools. The counselor(s) could continue to increase his/her familiarity with each of the Tech Ed programs and faculty with more classroom visits, and by attending department chairs’ and advisor board meetings. Having the counselor involved in making continuous improvements to the program as we move forward is essential to future success.
_
Celebrate Career Education! Event
In Spring 2018, the Technical Education is organizing and staging a college-wide event, Celebrate Career Education! To recognize students in the 39 Career Education programs on campus. Students enrolled in any Perkins-supported program who are working on certificates, degrees, are Skills Builders or have completed just one class may participate. It will be a fun, upbeat event to recognize and celebrate the many accomplishments of these students that are not otherwise acknowledged by the college community. We anticipate 700 students participating in Spring 2018. Celebrate! Also serves a critical second purpose: In order for students to participate—and have their name in the program—they must register online and provide three types of contact information. About a year after students leave the program they will be contacted by the CTE Outcome Survey and asked 26 well-crafted questions about their field of study, how it relates to their current work, their job search, etc. 

The results of this survey will be significantly improved with good contact information and registration for the Celebrate Career Education! Will provide us with that. The survey results will give all ARC Perkins-funded program departments and the division detailed, relevant program data on which to evaluate and improve student outcomes and success. The data will also aid in documenting any growth or challenges within certain Strong Workforce metrics for the college.  We propose to stage a second Celebrate! Event in May of 2019, anticipating more participants and continued improvement in the CEOS. We are requested funding for event security (campus police), facilities set up, marketing and promotion, outreach, contracted assistance for music, etc. and results.

All students in the Technical Education division benefit from having in-house, easily accessible counselors, but disproportionately impacted students in particular stand to gain the most. In addition to creating comprehensive education plans, Tech Ed counselors help support students by providing guidance about academic and program issues, financial aid, work-life-school balance, relevant social services, campus student support services including WAC and RAD, internship and employment opportunities, financial aid, scholarships, etc., all of which will improve their persistence and the chance of successful completion of their goals.",\n,\n,\n
"This project is a continuation of a Year 1 SWP project designed to increase capacity, enrollment, student success, and retention in ARC's Nursing Program. A full-time Nursing Instructor will allow the college to capture and maximize enrollments. The Nursing Student Success Coordinator will provide guidance, support, remediation and recommendations for student improvement in the nursing program in both theory and clinical performance. The Nursing IA will provide added support to Nursing students.","The overall attrition rate of the nursing program is 10 – 15%. While this is somewhat expected, we need to monitor closely the number of students who complete behind schedule. The impact of this creates an even greater challenge to students. The burden of having to repeat a course is multifaceted. These students are often devastated, the failure has a huge impact on their confidence. They are often financially challenged because they did not plan on being in school an extra semester or potentially an extra year. Their ability to get student loans is already a challenge due to the high number of college units to get into the program, and it delays their employment. The goal of the Nursing Student Success Coordinator is to identify and support these students to reduce the number of failures in all semesters of the program and increase on-time completions. The Student Success Program not only improves outcomes for currently enrolled students, but also allows for a full class of new students to enter the program each semester. This ultimately allows for more graduates, which in turn means more qualified RN’s in the workforce. The purpose of the Nursing Student Success Coordinator is to provide guidance, support, remediation and recommendations for student improvement in the nursing program in both theory and clinical performance. 1.

"We are working to attract new students into our programs, including through the use of an outreach location at the Sacramento Food Bank and a potential partnership with the Sacramento Job Corps Center.

We have an interest in better supporting small business/entrepreneurship and accounting students.  We are particularly interested in increasing participation by underrepresented groups.","We know there is a shortage of accountants and that most new jobs are created by small business owners, not by corporations.  In order to help fill these needs, we would like to create more opportunities for our students.  This includes expanding offerings to the Sacramento Food Bank and Family Services as well as to the Sacramento Job Corps Center.

It also includes providing better support to our accounting students.  Many of our course offerings have moved to online, so we have a need to expand our tutoring to online.  This has been test piloted in Summer 2018 and has been very successful, and we'd like to expand this program to best support the success of our students.",\n,\n,\n
"To increase automotive education opportunities with the addition of the automotive motorsports certificate, to increase student enrollment with a focus on disproportionately impacted students, and to provide more automotive related career paths with a better student learning experience.","Project Need:
Although not properly reflected by lagging LMI data, currently all areas within the automotive industry are experience a dramatic need for properly trained and skilled workers.   The most current LMI data shows a surplus of technician supply.  This however, is incorrect as much of the listed supply is produced by private technical schools in the Sacramento area.  These schools often ship in students from outside the region.  Once completed with the program these private school students usually return home and do not increase the total greater Sacramento area workforce.  I In addition our industry partners repeatedly inform us of the poor employee skill level they receive from employees trained by these same private technical schools. This on top of many other factors ranging from an aging workforce to a need of increased technical skills has created a strong demand for skilled workers in our region.  This includes the general repair side, representing dealers, fleets and independent repair shops which include a variety of positions ranging from service technicians, service writers, sales and parts.   In addition the automotive industry is rapidly expanding to include new focus areas ranging from alternative fuels, to automotive machine/manufacturing, to motorsports development.  These areas are above and beyond the normal automotive repair, sales and service side of the industry.  With this heightened demand the ability to attract talented students to this exciting career field is greater than ever before.


Project Task Areas:
To meet the industry wide need described above and to better serve our students this proposal is divided in to several task areas which will be briefly described below.

Program Outreach: dividing the greater Sacramento area in to regions the participating automotive facility will visit all high schools with automotive or general career education programs.  In addition automotive faculty will facilitate tours of the automotive department on a regular basis.
Dual Enrollment: Working closely with the workforce department, San Juan Unified school district and Natomas district, automotive facility will work towards the implementation of dual enrollment, (college classes on the high school campus) in the fall of 2018.  This includes but is not limed to: supporting new instructors and their facilities, coordinating different school schedules, attending meetings and troubleshooting problems.

Industry Support:  Automotive facility will visit multiple automobile businesses to increase support, build relationships, stay abreast of industry changes and create a network of internship sites for students.  This also includes hosting an automotive specific job fair for the spring semester.
Manufacture Partnerships:  Automotive facility will support the existing manufacture partnerships with, Fiat Chrysler, Toyota and Subaru as well as develop additional partnerships with various automotive manufactures.  This work includes: faculty training, student database management, certification tracking, curriculum review, participating in meetings & seminars.

Motorsports Education Program & Outreach:  The start of a new and dynamic hands-on training program requires many hours of work and dedication.  To complete this task automotive facility will interview motorsports industry professionals to determine tool and equipment needs, identify appropriate vendors and purchase all needed tools, equipment and supplies.  In addition automotive faculty will work with department staff to properly set up, train and organize all newly purchased equipment.  Lastly to ensure success of this new certificate program faculty will enlist the support of the industry and participate in outreach activities.
General Program Improvement: Automotive facility will interview students to identify program improvement areas of need and then work with department staff to purchase and set up new facility training stations to improve program organization and provide students with a strong experience

Student Support:
This project includes automotive outreach and support to a number of schools in the greater Sacramento area.  The dual enrollment portion of the project however, has a unique focus on disproportionately impacted students.  The two automotive dual enrollment school sites, located at San Juan high school and Natomas high school both feature a very diverse student population.  The majority of the student population at both of these schools fall under the chancellor’s office description of disproportionately impacted students.  With this, a major goal for this project is to help provide a better pathway to a successful career by bringing college level training to the students at these schools.  Our dual enrollment model is built on carefully developed stackable certificates that students start at the high school and can build upon at the college.  With this a participating student will be eligible for a variety of careers within the automotive industry.

"This projected will be an extension of the grant funded initiative where the department will offer the alterations shop experience, product development and the pop-up shop experience where students will gain real world access to suppliers. Students will also get real world experience conceptualizing, prototyping, producing and selling their own product.","Space is at a premium on the ARC campus. With the addition of year 2 grant funded Printing, Embroidery and Alterations Shop Project, the fashion department will need to update the classroom space to accommodate the machinery needed to offer students the product development, pop-up shop, alterations shop and printing shop experience. 

If the department gets this grant, the department will be able to better make use existing space. Students will be trained on and use state of the art equipment for design and development. The department will be able to provide an “exemplary teaching, learning and working environment” where students will gain the knowledge that they need in order to master a skill and achieve gainful employment in their community. The department will also increase enrollment for traditional and non-traditional students. Both degree seeking and non-degree seeking students will benefit from the skills based courses because students can take courses as needed. When they complete a course under the grant, they will be able to work with business partners through internships and job opportunities. Without this space, the department will have to “borrow space to set-up and run the machinery temporarily in other departments and spaces on campus. This will make scheduling and productivity a challenge because the department won’t have the machinery readily available. It is preferable to have the new and expensive machinery housed in the fashion design and merchandising classroom in Arts and Science 105. This will allow students to fully benefit from the facilities ARC provides. 

As previously mentioned in the last proposal, the Department of Labor stated that California has the highest rate of employment for tailors, dressmakers and custom sewers as of May 2016. In California, the median income for tailors, dressmakers and custom sewers is between $33K and $45K and offers the highest rate in pay in the country. There are 90 people employed in the Sacramento/Roseville/Arden Arcade area. There are over 24 alterations, dress making and tailoring businesses listed in the Sacramento area based on Google search. There are over 50 businesses that specialize in decorative finishes such as screen printing, heat setting, and embroidery. The employment opportunities for students of ARC are immense.  

Currently, the classroom is laid out with shelving and storage along all four walls. The tables that are used for cutting and sewing are 30” x 50” electric powered tables that raise and lower. The classroom also has 30 office chairs on casters that take up unnecessary amounts of space. The classroom has one large cutting table that is 4’ x 6’. Many students prefer to use this table because they can lay out patterns and cut fabric without the interruption of a curved table edge. In order to maximize on space, the department wants to remove most of the wall shelving, and all of the electric powered tables and office chairs. This will make room for 3 rows of industry standard 4’ x 5’ section cutting tables, stools and storage cabinets. The storage cabinets can be stored under the cutting tables. These storage cabinets will house our sewing machines. This will leave the classroom with additional square footage to store the dress forms and space for the new machinery. 

In addition to the new machinery, it is important that students work on industrial sewing machines. These machines are less expensive than the Bernina 1008 machines that students are taught on. Although there is not enough room to replace all the home machines with industrial machines, the department will have enough industrial machines to teach students how to use them. The department also wants to train students to use industrial iron stations that work with knits and delicate. The department has the industrial irons but lacks the iron stations that have vacuums and blowers. These are stations used by industrial stitchers, alterations specialists, active wear, shirting and bridal/evening wear designers. Students have the potential for employment in all of these areas. 

The update of the classroom will provide students with a better learning environment and experience. The room will be fully ADA accessible. In 2015/2016 Calpassplus.org stated that 14% of fashion students enrolled were disabled. It is important that all students have the tools and the right environment to succeed with skill attainment. Calpassplus.org also provided enrollment figures where in 2015/2016 633 enrollments of 749 total enrollments in the Fashion Department at ARC were of students who were economically disadvantaged. With such a large percentage of enrollments, it is very important for the department to provide the most up-to date and modern amenities in order for students to achieve skills and gain employment. If students do not have the facilities that are used in the industry, it will be difficult for them to get a job in the fashion field. Many interviewers will evaluate candidates by their knowledge and experience with certain machinery, techniques and software.",\n,\n,\n
"The Student-Centered Hackathon is now in its third year, in which a hacking and design challenge was developed for students to work together using technology (web, mobile, or other) to solve real-world problems.

In response to the changing demographic of our students in California, organizations such as the California Community College Association for Occupational Education (CCCAOE) have highlighted equity issues as a conference strand.  These funds will support faculty, staff, and administrators to attend Career Education conferences such as the CCCAOE Conference and bring back new ideas and best practices to American River College. 

Professional development for discipline specific and Career Education with emphasis on supporting disproportionately impacted students will be prioritized.  The intent is for faculty, staff, and administrators to learn about best practices in the classroom and organizationally to support disproportionately impacted students. ",\n,\n,\n
"The goal here is an experiential-based learning process that uses techniques to apply social justice learning, build new skills, further develop knowledge of team approaches with Deaf and Hearing interpreters, and to work effectively as trilingual interpreters and Deaf Parented Interpreters. The approach is to both provide support to assist in paying for current requirements and experiences. And, to provide safe opportunities where students can risk, grow and learn from their mistakes.","We anticipate growing the program in a variety of areas including the areas of social justice training, additional courses that focus on Deaf Parented Interpreters, interpreting students with knowledge of multiple languages (ex. ASL, English and Spanish), and students who are Deaf who plan on becoming interpreters. Additionally, there are many specialties within the interpreting field that require additional training and focus including: educational interpreting in the K-12 and post secondary settings, medical interpreting, mental health interpreting, interpreting for Deaf-Blind persons, conference interpreting, interactive interpreting, legal interpreting, etc.

Additionally, the Health Care Interpreting program and the ASL-Eng IPP have plans to work together to meet the needs of medical interpreting in the area.

Lab Coordinator, Lab Instructional Assistant, Lab availability:

A lab as a fundamental need for the development of interpreting skills is thoroughly documented in such research documents as the Entry to Practice Competencies for ASL- English and Deaf interpreters http://www.unco.edu/cebs/asl-interpreting/pdf/asl-english- interpretation/entry-to-practice-competencies.pdf and in the Commission on Collegiate Interpreter Education http://ccie-accreditation.org/wp- content/uploads/2014/12/CCIE_Accreditation_Standards_2014.pdf. Additionally, all ASL- English Interpreter Preparation Program (ASL-Eng IPP) and Deaf Culture and ASL Studies curricula require students to submit video documentation of ASL or interpreting work in order to conduct student self and peer reviews as well as to receive feedback from their professors.

A quick review of the Socrates curriculum for both the Deaf Culture and ASL Studies and the ASL-Eng IPP documents the need for a lab for these programs. All skills based courses require videotaped documentation of ASL skills for language classes and interpreting skills
 
for interpreting classes. Videotaping is difficult for students to complete outside of a lab due to the technology required for such documentation of skills and the sharing of the video documentation with peers and faculty for review. Additionally, all courses require the completion of additional lab activities that are completed in the lab. Additional Lab Instructional Assistant hours will allow for additional time to be covered in the lab such as Fridays or Saturdays.

Counselor/Facilitator for Cohort Processing and Persistence:
The ASL-Eng IPP is an intensive two-year program that consists of a cohort group. Due to the nature of interpreting in a system that is prone to marginalizing the community wherein the student interpreters function, there is an ongoing need to process, unpack and understand power, privilege, and oppression, and triggers. Both students and professors must necessarily focus on the need to understand intersecting social group memberships and positionality in order to raise awareness as how an intersectional lens changes the way we experience specific isms and their intersections. (Adams (2016) Teaching for Diversity and Social Justice, “Critical Self-Knowledge for Social Justice Educators”

A counselor/facilitator is needed in order to provide avenues for processing and self-care. Taking care of one’s needs is not a luxury; it is essential. In order for teachers and students to remain in a state of being where we can learn and use our widest skills, we need to manage change and stress in our lives.(Nieto (2010) Beyond Inclusion, Beyond Empowerment: A Developmental Strategy to Liberate Everyone) Ongoing, processing sessions facilitated and guided by a professional can both allow for increased student success and persistence during an educational program, and also provide tools for success in the working world.

National Evaluation Preparation and Completion:
For interpreting students, all national evaluations are provided via video documentation of the skills that are then submitted to evaluators. Lab access and availability are critical to the success of students during these evaluations. One such evaluation, the Educational Interpreting Performance Assessment (EIPA) is required for each student completing the program. “The EIPA is a tool that evaluates the voice-to-sign and sign-to voice skills of interpreters who work in the elementary through secondary classroom using videotape stimulus materials and a procedure that includes a comprehensive rating system.” https://www.classroominterpreting.org/EIPA/index.asp

The (ASL-Eng IPP) currently had numerous DVDs available from the www.classroominterpreting.org website. A fully functional lab is needed for student videotaping from English to ASL and ASL to English. Additionally, another national evaluation, the Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf (RID) National Interpreter Certification (NIC), may be taking by students. There are several elements including the NIC Knowledge Exam, NIC Performance Exam, the Certified Deaf Interpreter (CDI) Knowledge Exam and the Certified Deaf Interpreter Performance Exam. The NIC and CDI Knowledge Exams are computer-based tests. Students prepare by reading the required materials, available in the lab. And, online practice tests in preparation for the computer based test. The NIC and CDI Performance Exams tests the ability to apply the RID Code of Professional Conduct to ethical dilemmas in interpreting situations and real-world interpreting skills appropriate to an interpreter holding national certification.

Local and state evaluations also occur via a video documentation medium including the State Personnel Board Support Services Assistant-Interpreter state evaluation and the ARC DSPS interpreter assessment.

Payment for Fieldwork Experiences:
ASL-Eng IPP students have a particularly full final semester in the program. In particular, students must earn 108 hours of fieldwork experiences. Students struggle with having sufficient availability to fully access these experiences, particularly those students who are economically disadvantaged with little financial support. Provision of payment for the national evaluations and a stipend for the fieldwork experiences can provide the students with the time to focus on these experiences.

Deaf Interpreter/Trilingual Interpreter/Deaf Parented Interpreter Curriculum Infusion Developers
As has long been determined, based on the ASL-English Interpreter Preparation Program focus groups, advisory committee sessions, Deaf interpreter/trilingual/Deaf Parented Interpreter meetings, unique pathways are needed for each of the groups mentioned.
Special attention needs to also be emphasized for each group regarding social justice and representation of diverse populations. There are materials available. Time and expertise is needed to focus on the means of infusion and pathway development.

Summer Institute for Graduates Implementation
Following graduation, the cohort group must wait approximately 3 months for their Educational Interpreter Performance Assessment score. And, during the summer months there is very little if any work for a recent graduate. A summer institute that focuses on real world, hands-on experiences can help to bridge the gap.

There is research to document this need and a new Rehabilitation Services Administration grant that focuses on this: http://grad2cert.org/more-about-our-quest/.
Based on the concepts of situated learning, the following is proposed. http://www.cit-asl.org/new/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/FINAL-Miner- SituatingStudentLearning.pdf
Coordinator researches and collaborates in the development of situated learning with the following concept for implementation:
a.	Provide an orientation to the program.
b.	For each novice interpreter, provide a designated number of hours per week for 8-10 weeks involving situated learning experiences, case management follow up, and goal identification.
c.	Contract with a designated number of Deaf mentors who will provide real-world events where novice interpreters can interpret.
d.	Contract with certified interpreters, Deaf and hearing, who will provide case conferencing discussions with the novice interpreters and Deaf mentors.
e.	Provide a summary/closing to the program.

"Our program has been training veterinary technicians and veterinary assistants for 40 years, and serves both Urban populations as well as the rural regions north of us. in addition, the program is in the process of moving to a larger building to accommodate space need for students and animals. The increases class space will allow us to increase enrollment, including reaching out to skills builders who are working as Vet Assistants but seek to obtain Vet Tech License through the State's .","The YC Vet Tech Programs plans on expanding enrollment , improving completion and transfer rates, and improving employment and wages: Enrollment will be expanded through articulation agreements with local schools, through dual enrollment, outreach to secondary schools with Ag or animal science and by increasing facility classroom size that may enable us to increase size of enrollment cap. Completion rates will be improved through the use of College services. Transfer rates will be improved by aligning program with colleges that offer B.S degree in Vet Tech or animal Science. Employment rates and earnings will be increase by teaching skills unique to employment in large animal, animal shelters, and food safety.",\n,\n,\n
"This project is a multi year public safety expansion project in our region that will span multiple funding cycles.","There is a need for more trained fire fighters/public safety officers in the region and in the state. The Community College League of California estimates that 80 percent of the states firefighters, law enforcement officers and emergency medical technicians received their training at an academy on or affiliated with a local Community College campus. There is not enough regional specialized facility capacity or course capacity to meet the regional demand for employers. The project will increase the number of fire fighter and public safety trained students annually. This project will address the need for more trained firefighters, as well as those in the public safety arena related to wilderness careers and regional Search and Rescue.",\n,\n,\n
"This is a new certificate program for Respiratory Therapists and other qualified allied health and medical professionals. This certificate provides these professionals with advanced training in interventional pulmonology including diagnostic and therapeutic
interventions.		","In general, Interventional Pulmonology is a relatively new medical subspecialty.		The first Board
Certification for Pulmonologists (MD) in this subspecialty was Dec 6, 2013.		
Pulmonologist certified in this specialty will need trained respiratory therapists, physician
assisants or nurses to perform the techniques and procedures in development.
In order to be at the forefront of this new subspecialty, El Camino Hospital recruited Ganesh
Krishna from Stanford Hospital in 2008		to head their Interventional Pulmonology Unit (see below
in Attachment C for details of El Camino Hospital Interventional Pulmonology program).		
Pulmonology fellows from UCSF are being trained by Dr. Krishna to bring this subspecialty to
UCSF.		Stanford Hospital has recently opened their Interventional Pulmonology department
headed by Dr. Andrew Sung. Therefore this field is beginning to open up locally and we believe
demand will be strong for trained Allied Health professionals for this type of specialty training.",\n,\n,\n
"Language Coaches will support students whose Language of Service is a language other than Spanish with:
•Expanding medical vocabulary in their language of service
•Developing skills in facilitating bilingual, cross cultural communication 
•Providing meaningful feedback during Interpreting simulation labs completed in students’ Languages of Service
","Currently application processing and all of the steps necessary to ensure students meet the long list of requirements to complete externship hours in hospitals and clinics are the responsibility of one faculty member, who is responsible for instruction, curriculum development, budget management, community outreach, student management, fieldwork contract development, observation of students at clinical fieldwork placements, general office management, etc. (no other faculty or adjunct is part of the HCI Program).  When the Clerk can aid with these tasks, the faculty member can focus on instruction and student support.  

Additionally, our current partnerships with externship sites are not as diverse as they could be, or optimal for students in some language groups. If faculty is relieved of these tasks, faculty will have the capacity to seek other partnerships in the community that will offer students a better diversified experience in the field they will enter and make them more marketable in the workforce, while matching more students with preceptors or their specific language of service. 

High enrollment of special populations and non-traditional students is evident in the Healthcare Interpreting Program.  With the Clerk III taking on tasks including organizing applications, tracking health compliance and partnership contracts, and assisting in candidate selection and website/web-tool maintenance, the Clerk III will significantly lighten the burden on faculty to allow more time to focus on instruction and extra support for students, as well as time to seek additional partnerships with externship sites, which offer students opportunities to network with prospective employers.

"The objective is to significantly increase enrollment in the Sacramento City College Mechanical Electrical Technology (HVAC/R) programs by offering a daytime certificate and degree program to mirror the existing evening program.  This would provide trained, job-ready workers to meet severe industry labor shortages.  jhis will result in economic benefits to graduates, and economic benefits and growth for employers and Greater Sacramento Region..","     Projected growth rate for the Heating, Ventilation, & Air Conditioning/Refrigerant (HVAC/R) field is substantial. In the Greater Sacramento Region, California, and the nation there is a shortage of trained, qualified labor. SCC’s Mechanical Electrical Technology program is the only comprehensive, lab-based HVAC/R program in the LRCCD and the Greater Sacramento Region. The demand from industry partners for this training will continue to grow.  The Fall 2017 day courses filled.  Enrollments are expected to be strong in Fall 2018.
     Because of the strong program established at Sacramento City College, SCC MET Depart has been designated by the North Far North and Sector Navigator as a Regional Hub, to provide assistance to other colleges within the North Far North, and other regions, wishing to establish HVAC/R programs.  This involvement will support the goals of this sector to meet the Task Force recommendations for Curriculum and Regional Coordination",\n,\n,\n
"Sacramento City College has the unique opportunity to offer occupational training for a new and emerging career and business field which affects many industry sectors – aerial photography and imaging using remote piloting and unmanned vehicles.  SCC is the only NFN college with FAA certified Aviation programs.  SCC Photography and Aviation faculty are working closely together to develop two stackable certificates which which will provide new employment and business opportunities for students."," After completing the SCC Aviation Dept's Commercial Remote Pilot Program, and receiving an FAA remote pilot certificate, students will then be able to complete the Commercial Aerial Photography and Imaging certificate which will teach these specialized skills and techniques required for this type of photography and imaging.  This new technology is currently being tested and used in a variety of industries and fields.  It offers a new opportunity for pilots, as well as photographers.  These will be stackable and interdisciplinary certificates.  This will open up emerging markets for existing photographers, as well as those new to the field.  
     Because this is an emerging field, its true impact is not fully known.  However, the US Dept of Transportation and the FAA have agreed “…by 2025, …integration of UAV’s into the U.S. National Airspace System will add $82 billion to the US economy and add well over 100,000 jobs.”  The estimate of jobs created for California between 2015-2025 is 18,161.
     Photography and imaging are one of the primary objectives of the commercial use of drones.  The need for individuals to be trained not only to remotely pilot these tools, but to skillfully manage the images and photographs taken will be critical.  These certificates will provide a level of credibility.
     This proposal requests funds to support the Photography Dept in developing this curriculum and obtaining the necessary support and equipment.

"This project will fund lab equipment upgrades and lab support staff.","Implementation of this project is to upgrade the current levels of instruction by replacing worn out milling machines to 21st century equipment that students will use in today’s workplace. The current equipment is worn and some of the micrometer collars are unreadable. We will purchase 2 surface grinders, which the lab does not currently have. We will add 2 new harness testers to accommodate the 24 student class size, and we will replace the lathes. It is time to replace the machines with upgraded equipment to provide machining accuracy for students to complete projects and learn manual turning skills. The current equipment is worn and some of the micrometer collars are unreadable. This makes it very difficult for students to produce a quality part expected in today’s industry.

"This proposal is to continue utilizing a temporary LRCCD Clerk II position to assist with work with allied health programs. Duties include maintaining agency contracts, monitoring of student compliance for clinical placement, supporting revisions of program applications, and monitoring student progress in online clinical rotation management system.","Managing allied health programs has dramatically increased in complexity. Multiple contracts must be maintained, students must complete an array of requirements before clinical placement, program applications designed and processed, and websites regularly reviewed and updated. Many allied health programs must be approved/accredited by outside agencies necessitating detailed self-studies. Additionally, allied health programs must respond to legislative changes/mandates in addition to changes to the Educational code. The Program Assistant position would free Program Directors from the massive amounts of clerical work in order to focus on more pressing matters, such as clinical site recruitment.",\n,\n,\n
"While the MLT program has had great success, it has done so in a somewhat unstructured manor. Recently an Entry Level Curriculum document was released by ASCLS which outlines which topics to teach, and at what level.   The program will also hire an temporary LRCCD Clerk II position to assist with work with allied health programs and Clinicial Site Recruitment Specialist to recruit and maintain clinical placement sites.","The number of clinical sites the MLT program has directly corresponds to the number of students the MLT program accepts on a yearly basis. Due to several outside factors, the amount of clinical sites the MLT program regularly maintains has dropped each year. Since clinical sites are extremely difficult to obtain, the program has not been able supplement these losses with new clinical partners. As a result MLT program enrollments have dropped, not for lack of interest, but because the program does not have enough clinical partners to complete the training. To avoid accepting students that have no option for a clinical placement, the overall number of students accepted into the program is reduced to the current number of clinical partners. 

To avoid this continued downward trend, the MLT Program seeks to hire a temporary LRCCD Clerk II position to support the program director.  Duties include  maintaining agency contracts, monitoring of student compliance for clinical placement, supporting revisions of program applications, and monitoring student progress in online clinical rotation management system. A temporary Clinical Site Recruitment Specialist will also be hired as recruiting clinical sites is a job in and of itself and takes time and travel away from the college. A recruiter would connect potential clinical sites to the MLT Program Director to maintain, and hopefully increase, the number of MLT students admitted each year. This proposal also works toward the ultimate goal of better regionalizing the MLT program.  Additionally, We are taking steps to impletment a new Entry Level Curriculum based on current data released from ASCLS which outline MLT topics to teach and at what levels they should be taught.  tThis is especially important given our accreditation inspection is rapidly approaching.

The MLT program is due for its National Accrediting Agency for Clinical Laboratory Science (NAACLS) accreditation and inspection. As with other accreditations, there are costs associated to bring inspectors to our campus, and other accreditation fees.  Without NAACLS accreditation students lose the ability to sit for the national exam, and thus cannot be nationally licensed. Furthermore, accreditation ensures the MLT program is meeting the highest standards in the country, which directly benefits student success and student outcomes.

The Los Rios District has regional funding set aside for clinical placement specialist and this person was hired in summer 2018. While the new hire assesses need and develops a plan, FLC has an immediate need for support in clinical site recruitment. Depending on the plan and direction of the regional clinical site placement coordinator, FLC may be able in the future to leverage that regional resource. ",\n,\n,\n

Attending these conferences proves that we participate in continuous program improvement and can identify pitfalls before they are called out on an inspection.  ","As referenced in the description, there are no reasonable alternatives to learning best-practices, accreditation standards, changes to national exam, etc. Without this information the MLT program will ultimately fail to meet changing standards at the expense of its students. We maintain an 100% national exam pass rate in large part because we are on top of the latest and greatest practices presented at the Clinical Laboratory Educators conference. We seek to send faculty to this conference to ensure we can cover all seminars and to keep faculty involved in said best practices.

"This project will provide ARC CTE faculty the opportunity to complete, as a campus cohort, the ACUE Course. ACUE’s Course in Effective Teaching Practices prepares college educators to implement essential practices shown to improve student outcomes. The framework for this course has been endorsed by the American Council on Education and achieved QM certification after a nationally recognized quality assurance review.","The 2015 recommendations of the Chancellor’s Task Force on Workforce, Job Creation, and a Strong Economy were the result of months of deliberations based on input from a wide variety of sources reflecting agreement from both internal and external stakeholders of the community college system. These recommendations enhance career technical education and workforce training to meet the demands, or needs, of California’s economy and the regional and local labor markets. Meeting those needs results in benefiting individuals (CTE students), local and regional communities, and the entire state. Recommendations 2, and 15 are the primary recommendations directly addressed in the proposed project.

Recommendation #2 Improve CTE student progress and outcomes.
Regardless of frank retention metrics or life-long learning outcomes, research demonstrates strong ties between faculty engagement and positive student outcomes. Umbach and Warsynski, in Faculty Do Matter: The Role of College Faculty in Student Learning and Engagement1 suggest that “faculty-student interaction is frequently among the best predictors of both learning outcomes and term to term persistence”. The proposed project provides detailed strategies for ARC’s CTE faculty to improving their faculty-student interactions thereby in improving student progress and outcomes. Perhaps the abstract of Umbach and Warsynski’s research, cited previously, best summaries the impact the proposed project will address. The abstract states:

“Our findings suggest that students report higher levels of engagement and learning at institutions where faculty members use active and collaborative learning techniques, engage students in experiences, emphasize higher-order cognitive activities in the classroom, interact with students, challenge students academically, and value enriching educational experiences”

Recommendation #15 Enhance professional development opportunities for CTE faculty to maintain industry and program relevance. 

Investment in professional faculty development has repeatedly proven to have the greatest impact on student progress and successful outcomes. In 2016, the Education Advisory Board (EAB) published “The Evolving Role of Faculty in Student Success”2.  The article is based on interviews with 120 higher education leaders. It says that without engagement among faculty, “most top-down student success initiatives are doomed to fail, either through outright opposition or because of a limited reach.” The paper continues by stating “Critical reforms that pertain to curricular requirements, academic policies, advising practices and transfer articulation all rely on the willingness of faculty to redesign the institutional approach and carry out a new set of procedures. The most important responsibility of individual faculty members is to enhance the student learning experience. Pedagogical innovations may be plentiful on campuses, but training and support in those practices may be lacking. Administrators should reduce the opportunity cost of experimentations in the classroom and leverage faculty leaders to expand effective teaching techniques across departments.”
This proposed project will empower CTE faculty leaders to expand the use of known, effective, and evidence-based teaching techniques across the college’s CTE departments. The proposed project provides faculty members with a significant variety of, innovative teaching strategies to help ensure program relevance, student success, and provide students with valuable 21st century skills.

The ACUE course includes seven main modules which collectively encompass 31 sub-modules including; 

•	Designing an Effective Course and Class
•	Establishing a Productive Learning Environment 
•	Using Active Learning Techniques
•	Promoting Higher Order Thinking
•	Assessing to Inform Instruction and Promote Learning
•	Embedding Career Guidance (new in Fall 2018)
•	Preparing Students with 21st-Century Career Ready Skills (new in Fall 2018)

Sub-modules include topics such as:

•	Establishing Powerful Learning Outcomes
•	Aligning Assessment with Course Outcomes
•	Preparing an Effective Syllabus
•	Planning an Effective Class Session
•	Using Active Learning Techniques in Small and Large Groups
•	Planning Effective Class Discussions
•	Providing Clear Directions and Explanations
•	Teaching Powerful Note-Taking Skills
•	Using Advanced Questioning Techniques
•	Developing Self-Directed Learners
•	Developing and Using Rubrics and Checklists
•	Providing Useful Feedback

ACUE’s course in Effective Teaching Practices, and related program services will be facilitated through American River College’s Center for Teaching and Learning (CTL). Doing so will allow faculty to receive regular coaching from experts in faculty development that is tailored to the unique needs and culture of our students and campus. ACUE’s course, along with ACUE’s additional program support services, will provide a significant expansion of the CTL’s ability to support more faculty and, in the process, make quality instruction a strategic element of American River College’s student success strategy. This collaborative approach is a defining feature of ACUE’s approach and key to effective implementations at colleges and universities nationwide.

Selected ARC CTE faculty members will engage the ACUE course work entirely online over a two semester timeline. The project provides the option of a cohort of 30 or 60 depending on the funding levels of the project. Efforts will be made to periodically gather the cohort, on campus, to ensure project oversight and address any issues that may arise. The course facilitator will lead this gathering. Upon completion of each module, CTE faculty will then implement various techniques in their classrooms. After implementation, faculty will then reflect on the impact various practices had on their courses and students. Reflections are submitted to a course facilitator and course reader who measure the quality of the submitted reflections against a transparent rubric. Feedback is provided to individual faculty when submissions require additional clarification. At the conclusion of all coursework, CTE faculty members receive a certificate in effective college instruction endorsed by the American Council on Education (ACE).

Clearly, this certification meets the needs identified by the Strong Workforce Recommendations but also begins to address one of the goals of the American River College Strategic Plan. Details on the impact this project will have on one of the strategic goals is covered in another section of the application.

ACUE’s course is based on more than three decades of research which identifies specific teaching practices that improve learning for all students, with an especially strong impact among historically underrepresented students. Here is some additional information answering this question: 

Underrepresented, first-generation and low-income students now comprise the new majority of students entering our doors and online learning environments each year, and their completion rates lag far behind their peers. The students with access to transparent instruction reported significantly higher levels of satisfaction in three areas considered to be important predictors of success: academic confidence, sense of belonging, and improvement of skills that employer’s value. The positive outcomes were even greater for first-generation, low-income, and traditionally underrepresented students [1].

The findings presented in Unpacking Relationships: Instruction and Student Outcomes are relevant to students regardless of the type of institution or academic program they chose. Given the research about the barriers first-generation students and those from under-resourced communities and schools face in completing credentials and degrees, it is likely more student-centered, attainment-focused instructional approaches will have a disproportionately large and positive impact on students from underserved communities.

From an ACUE blog post by Steven Taylor:https://community.acue.org/blog/seeking-better-student-outcomes/",\n,\n,\n
"The Horticulture Department will be working towards increasing student enrollment, the number of completions, and higher employment rates and wages for completer.  Non-instructions salaries and benefits, facilities upgrade and ongoing facilities maintenance will also be an integral part of helping us achieve our goals","There is a clear need to increase the percentage of horticulture completers who are gainfully employed within the field and to increase their wages upon completion. Fifty percent of completers are employed in the field after completion at a relatively good living wage (approximately 20/hour or 40K/year) but the percentage of completers gainfully employed in the field needs to be increased along with their salary. The other need that motivates the project is that the number of enrolled students in the program needs to increase along with the percentage of students completing a certificate of degree.  The number of students enrolled in the Horticulture Program has remained relatively steady at around 100 over the past several years however the number of students receiving a degree or certificate has also remained at less than 10% of those enrolled.
Our proposed project aims to increase the number of students enrolled in the program while providing a better program with clear pathways to completion in both specific and general areas of horticulture. The industry demand for this is significant and wages are increasing in the field especially for specific skills such as small area high yield plant production (urban farming and hydroponics), irrigation technologies and sustainable landscape practices to name a few.
The proposed project will address these needs through several different approaches all with common goals. We will coordinate outreach to secondary and post-secondary students to make them aware of the career opportunities in horticulture to increase the number of enrolled students. Facilities and equipment upgrades and ongoing maintenance expenses will be required in order to align our instruction with industry standards and to increase the amount of areas that can be used for urban farming in our area in addition to simply making our area safer for our students, faculty and classified staff.  Many trees in our area need to be trimmed or removed to increase sun exposure for urban farming instruction as well as to remove trees that are unsafe to walk under due to their age and condition. Our department would like to get accredited by the National Association of Landscape Professionals and will need to update and revise current curriculum and will need to pay for the accreditation.  Along with the new accreditation required updates to the curriculum pathways will be developed in order to increase the percentage of students completing degrees and certificates above the current >10%.
In addition to on-boarding outreach efforts to increase the number of enrolled students we will also be attending industry association career fairs and events with students in order to get them placed into gainful employment. Specifically, we will be bringing 12 students to the 2019 National Collegiate Landscape Competition (NCLC) to attend the career fair and to compete against seventy other community colleges and universities from across the nation. This type of event provides optimal opportunity for our students to get employed at higher than normal salary levels as well as increases the awareness of our program to the landscape and horticulture industry.

Dis-proportionality impacted students will benefit from the proposed project because 50% of students enrolled in the Horticulture Program are non-traditional.  This percentage is common within the horticulture industry",\n,\n,\n

"The purpose of Virtual Reality Project is to provide Virtual Reality (VR) training and education for student improvement under extremes of pressure. This VR training will take place in the EMT, Paramedic, RT, and nursing programs in clinical performance.
","The overall approximate initial attrition rate of EMT, paramedic, RT, and nursing programs is 10 – 15%. Another 10-15% fail while in their clinical or field rotations. While this is somewhat expected, we need to monitor closely the number of students who fail and/or complete behind schedule. Students who fail or fall behind at any phase of their education are greatly impacted. The burden of having to repeat a course is multifaceted. These students are often psychologically devastated; the failure has a huge impact on their confidence and later college success. They are often financially challenged because they did not plan on being in school an extra semester or potentially an extra year. Their ability to get student loans is already a challenge due to the high number of college units to get into the programs, and it delays their employment. The goal of the VR program is to build, strengthen, identify, and support all students to reduce the number of failures in the clinical and field phases of their program. This ultimately allows for more graduates, which in turn means the community colleges are producing more qualified EMT’s, Paramedics, RT’s and RN’s in the workforce. VR achieves this goal by allowing students to come as close as possible to performing the skills they will actually have to perform under pressure in the workplace.  This better CTE represents a rare opportunity for students to actually “perform” the tasks they need to perform on the job. Additionally, VR will have a positive impact on the usage of high fidelity simulation that the college presently does. There is a huge backlog for the use of high fidelity simulation, and most students get only 3-5 rotations on high fidelity simulation because of this backlog. Additionally, the high fidelity simulators are often accidently damaged or broken by students.   VR allows the student many more opportunities to practice, fail, correct their performance, and then attempt to be successful again.  VR also allows students to have more and better CTE in that it allows them multiple attempts to be successful, something which is presently lacking in both lab training and high fidelity simulation. 
VR will also contribute to student success in that it will allow students to perform better in high fidelity simulations. At present, students are only allowed 1-5 high fidelity simulations per semester, because of demand, and because the simulators are so expensive. Using VR, students could have multiple attempts at learning and refining their knowledge base and their critical thinking skills. 

Large numbers of students struggle and often fail in the EMT, paramedic, RT and Nursing programs because they are under prepared for the stresses of running calls under pressure in both the field and hospital environments. Many students do fine with no pressure, but fail to perform under the stresses of real patients and the chaotic nature of many real world calls. Students will be guided through stressful calls using VR under the guidance of an experienced professor and then given ample opportunity to de-brief and finally to reflect upon areas of strength and areas of growth and then allow students mulitiple attempts until they are successful.

This coordinator is responsible for overseeing the development of the program, curriculum, staff, and additional concerns as needed. Overseeing the budgets for each department. Promoting the department to industry in various ways to promote them and build relationships for our students who are entering the employment fields. This investment will support disproportionately impacted students by creating more awareness in parts of the community that we haven’t communicated with as of yet. We are starting to create awareness of the growing demand for diesel technicians and collision repair technicians through the local high schools. Students of our programs help spread the word, but we also need to work in conjunction with our local industry in building stronger pathways and job opportunities for our students that are or will be entering the workforce. Through various articles and talking to our industry partners we find that there is a major need for qualified technicians. We instruct and train students through the classroom and lab projects actual hands on experiences that they use in the workforce. The coordinator will continue to work with staff and assist in bringing more industry to our programs to build additional pathways for our students to thrive and build connections with. Along with building connections, the coordinator will continue to keep both programs on the cutting edge of new technology that we will impart to our students. By staying in contact with our industry partners, it also allows for knowledge of updated training that our instructors should be taking so that they can pass that knowledge where applicable to the students.

"In response to industry trends in which the use of drones as a new and integral tool in the traditional activities covered in the Design Technology we have been developing the ability to integrate drones into our existing program. We offer 5 courses which include modules focusing on the use of drone technology, we help support the Drone Club, we have supported the Engineering Club drone efforts and we have flown various activities on campus (Graduation Ceremony).","The ability to provide a well trained and skilled workforce to our industry partners has been identified as a critical need in our area.  At this time, the demand for skilled entry level workers outstrips our graduating class (Link to job recruitment postings by our partners, Link to area job posting data based on keyword searches ), and as such, our program must demonstrate our capability to enroll and place more students.  
 
We have identified that a drone program will provide a new component to our program with significant interest from entering students.  Our advisory committee has identified a large number of applications of drones and two of our recent graduates are working with data produced by drones.  One of our industry partners has specifically asked for an intern who also has worked with drones.  Our experience with the Drone Club has shown us that a work experience component is critical to providing the hands on time required to develop the understanding of drone safety / regulation and operation.  This project expects to meet this need by providing focused training in our curriculum and then providing a work experience component in a new certificate.  This new certificate will not only meet an emerging industry need, but will also increase enrollment in our program.  To meet this need, the Design Tech Department plans to address the following categories of improvement: 
 
Equipment: 
?	Drones 
?	Low end practice drones for operational training 
	?	Medium capability drones with state of the art features 
	?	High end with excellent video and data capture equipment 
?	Computing 
?	High capacity computing system with cloud data storage capabilities to handle the large amount of data developed with the drones. 
Software: 
?	Advanced 3D Modeling (Point Cloud development and manipulation) 
Human Resources 
?	Paid Student Interns (Student Help … Work Experience) 
?	Faculty Project Oversight (ESAs for faculty project oversight) 
?	Temporary Classified Student Program Assistants (ARC Drone Range Officer) 
?	Support of Purchasing Personnel (classified temporary) dedicated to Strong Workforce Purchasing 

 
At this time, access to drones which are capable of high level use is still expensive, time consuming, and highly regulated.  Our students from underserved populations are rarely provided access to this technology and this lack of access will prove to be a barrier to employment when the 
technology becomes part of the expected tool set of a new hire (much like computer skills are required now).  By providing this access through a formalized education course, underserved populations will be able to qualify for financial aid as part of their ISEP, they will be given training and will become familiar with this important new tool for the design workplace.  With early adoption of this technology, students may find themselves in a position of advantage when entering the workforce.

"Create a new program targeting Financial Wellness best practices at Sacramento City College for Career Education students. Establishing a Financial Wellness Program and embedding it into the CE community for the benefit of student education (knowledge) and action (increased course completion/retention, smart money management, reduced debt, etc.) is vital.  The overarching goal is to find new ways to effectively support students on the path to graduation and beyond.","CE student success can be enhanced by financial wellness services.  It is critical to develop new methods to educate and support these students to ensure they manage debt, thoughtfully consider the role of both loans and savings, develop habits to practice budgeting, and navigate financial crises.  Also, it is equally important that these students who would qualify for free financial assistance actually receive that assistance.  Connecting students to financial resources, educating faculty and staff about the availability of these support services, and teaching financial literacy are key goals of program.  
Also, about 60% of all (CE included) SCC students identify as low income or below poverty level.  Financial assistance (grants and/or loans) is a reality for most of SCC’s 22,000 students, with 66% currently accepting some form of financial aid to attend college.  The current loan default rate is about 22%.  
African American and Hispanic/Latino students have average course success rates that are consistently lower than White or Asian students.  Fall 2016 course success rates for African American and Hispanic/Latino students were about 52% and 63% respectively compared to White (73%) and Asian (75%).  Also, African American and Hispanic students had relatively low 30-unit completion rates compare to the SCC rate of 63.5%.  Given that financial issues often force students to drop out of school, it is critical to develop intervention strategies to assist these students, so they will stay in school and graduate.

"•	Legal Database Subscription
•	Secondary Sources – Legal Research Books 
•	Mock Interview Event
•	New Courses – Immigration Law, Law Office Technology, and a Legal Clinic 
•	Notary Course
•	Employment Readiness Workshop 
•	Increase Offering of Online Courses","Increase the number of students in CTE courses, programs, and pathways: 
•	Campus Visits – conduct high school and college visits to bring awareness to current students that the Legal Assisting program exists at ARC and a certificate can be obtained in 2 semesters if the student is able to attend full time. 
•	Digital Advertising – create digital advertising to target specific underrepresented groups for enrollment in the Legal Assisting program.  
•	Online Classes – Although we are not able to offer a 100% online education, we can increase the current number of classes offered online.  I would like to hire an online teaching consultant to help us transition current face-to-face classes to an online and/or hybrid format that is compliant with the American Bar Association guidelines.  We are an ABA – approved program, which means that we not only have to comply with district standards for curriculum, but the ABA standards as well.  

Increase the number of quality CTE courses, programs, and pathways: 
•	Experimental Immigration, Legal Technology, and Legal Clinic Courses – the Legal Assisting program does not currently offer any of these courses, but they would add immense educational value to our students. 
•	Expand Library Resources – Students need access to secondary sources, sources that explain how the law is used and how to draft legal documents. Currently we do not have corresponding secondary sources for all classes offered. Expanding our library resources will help professors better prepare students to enter the workforce.  
•	Online Legal Database Subscription – Every law firm or legal services organization has access to an online legal database and it is imperative that professors train students to conduct research using the online databases. While the school currently has access to Nexis Uni, Nexis Uni does not include the majority of the legal databases our students will use in the workplace.  
•	Portable Computer Lab – Legal professionals use computers for the majority of tasks they complete, however, our students are still being taught in classrooms without access to computers or internet. A portable computer lab will give students online access in the classroom to go hand-in-hand with classroom instruction.


To improve upon Core Indicator 1 – Skill Attainment, students need to improve upon their online research skills and need access to an online legal database, Westlaw or Lexis Nexis.  Approximately 99% of legal research is now done using one of the aforementioned databases.  

To improve in Core Indicator 4 – Employment, we plan to host a mock interview event with local employers and volunteers from the Sacramento County Bar Association and special interest bar associations.  This allow students to practice their interviewing skills, and will bring potential employers to our campus who will look to hire ARC students in the future.  

In addition, we would like to expand our curriculum to include Immigration Law and Legal Technology.  The goal is to offer these two courses as experimental courses by Spring 2019 and to include them as a part of our regular course offering by Spring 2020.  

To assist with employment readiness, we would like to also include a legal services clinic in our curriculum.  We will partner with individual attorneys and/or a legal services business to host weekly clinics for low-income individuals in the community.  Students will put their learning into action under the supervision of legal professionals.  Initially we will need funding to develop the clinic, and then we will need funding to run and staff the clinic with a professor. 

In order to increase our student’s employability, we would also like to offer a notary course that is not part of the curriculum, but that would be available to all Legal Assisting students.  Paralegals become infinitely more valuable to employers when they are able to notarize documents. 

Lastly, We would like to offer an employment readiness workshop that includes, but is not limited to, proper interview attire, dining etiquette, resume and cover letter writing, and interview preparation.  

The area is performing below negotiated levels in Core Indicator 5a – Traditional Participation and 5b – Traditional Completions.  In order to recruit and retain non-traditional students, displaced homemakers, economically disadvantaged students, single parents, and students with disabilities, we plan to increase our digital advertising, increase our offering of online classes, and increase our online and print legal research materials.  

As our student enrollment increases, we will also be able to offer more daytime classes for students who use public transportation, students who care for young children, and for students who would like to complete the program by attending school full-time during the day.

","The first phase in implementing some of the changes made to create a “simulated workplace” to further enhance the job skills students learn from our program.  We find that students learn the science and techniques of welding, but lack some of the fabrication skills needed to secure and keep the jobs available to them.  Last year’s allocation allowed us to set up new workstations, the request in this application would set these workstations up with fabrication tools and lighting.  One of the most common complaints we get from students is the quality of lighting in the welding lab, which makes it more difficult for some of our students to work on projects.  The LED lighting we are proposing would provide lighting of the new workstations as well as replace the old tubes throughout the shop.  These new lights would improve the quality of lighting and also vastly improve energy efficiency while still using the existing fixtures to save on cost.

We provide this equipment for our students because without it they could not afford to take the training that has resulted in the students qualifying for a job in law enforcement.  Without this equipment our students would not be able to succeed. We are required to store this equipment in a secure location to prevent damage and/or possible injury if someone other than trained staff should try and utilize that equipment without authorization.  Equipment purchased with SWP funding will be maintained for student use and will be stored on campus.  In order to meet the demands of increased student numbers in Law Enforcement Academy/POST, Fire Academy, Corrections Academy and EMT/Paramedics Academy, SWP funding has been provided to temporarily support for one year the position of HPS division administrative secretary.

"Maintain increased capacity to assist Nursing students in successfully completing all requirements of the program in a timely manner, and to ensure that they are safe practitioners prior to their clinical experience in a hospital.","The project is motivated by the increased demand for nurses in the workforce.  This project will address these needs by providing additional facuty tutors, tutor time, weekly workshops for students and facilitate the opening of a dedicated open skills lab in the evenings to assist students in the practice of their nursing skills.  Nursing requires students to be proficient not only in didactics but in the clinical area.  Before entering any hospital setting the students must go through rigorous testing, skills practice, skills demonstration and check-offs that provide instructors with the appropriate feedback to assess the students preparedness to attend clinical and practice on patients.  Another aspect to improving student retention is providing a supportive, professional study/student classroom environment that is conducive to learning and provides an arena for innovative teaching strategies that encompass a variety of learning styles.

","Folsom Lake College is a very young college and the smallest in the Los Rios Community College District. Until the allocation of SWP funding, the focus of college offerings was primarily academic and for transfer. Career Education (CE) programming was combined with Athletics and there was not enough administrative oversight, classified staff support, or focus on CE outreach. The new College President has determined that CE will be a focus of growth. The CE Dean will provide direction and support for CE programming to include, but not limited to strengthening enrollments in current offerings and advising the college regarding programs where labor markets have shifted; working with curriculum committee to streamline curriculum development through the process; leading participation in the Code Alignment project and reworking of the biennial program review to include inclusion of LaunchBoard data; educating deans and faculty regarding the SWP metrics and importance of creating programs that have labor  market data support; and working with the deans of FLC's two centers (El Dorado and Rancho Cordova) to bring CE programming to these centers focused on community desire and needs.

Specifically, the project will identify the top three best Career Education (CE) programs for each of the FLC college sites: Folsom Lake College and the Rancho Cordova and El Dorado Centers. Each is demographically diverse with very different employment needs and opportunities. ","Folsom Lake College is comprised of 3 campuses all with unique demographics and employment/ education demands from local employers. A thorough investigation of employer needs should be conducted to determine validity and viability of adding or enhancing new CE programs before creating and investing in new programs that may only be short term in nature, not pay a sustainable wage or not have a significant high enough demand. Moreover, there is a lack of leveraging the I-50 corridor resources from Placerville to Rancho Cordova--an area that will be strengthened by Folsom City's growth on the east side of I-50. Given we are an outcomes-driven college, additional research is needed to ensure return on investment before investing in new program delivery or enhancement. Labor market data alone is not enough.  Additionally, this funding will support FTE in new courses in new programs (i.e. growth) that are not currently available through college/district FTE allocations. ",\n,\n,\n

"Develop and deploy a FLC Call Center to assist current CE Program staff and faculty by serving as a point of contact for  potential CE students to call or email questions.  The Call Center design will be  based on assessment and analysis conducted in spring 2018 using SWP funding. The Call Center staff will work closely with CE program staff for training and communication specific to each CE program. ","FLC CE programming is small and departments are often staffed by one full-time faculty and in some cases only adjunct. Faculty desire the ability to directly speak with students about their programming, but no unified approach exists. Potential students may contact the CE Division Office, typically the Dean, resulting in a delay in answering queries. Inevitably, the student is redirected to a faculty member via email or phone.

"This project is a continuance of one funded by CCCCO through the California Healthcare Academy Project. That funding stream was originally designated to end December 2019, but that end date was revised by CCCCO to December 2018. Funds will support the full development to provide the three Imaging programs via Distance Education with FLC serving as the hub for Imaging education across the state.","This program is the result of a sentinel event in the healthcare industry. Currently, there is no formal education for CT, MRI, or IR workers. Students may self-study and have an employer verify skills completed. This, in part, led to a large healthcare organization imaging clients with excessive levels of radiation resulting in negative outcomes. This program establishes a standard level of education for each of the Imaging modalities.  Additionally, this project will provide Imaging education via distance education throughout the state for two reasons. First, allied health programs are very expensive thus difficult to replicate in multiple locations. Second, there is a great demand for CT, MRI, and IR trained personnel, but the demand is not of sufficient scope in any one college area to support the development of a program. In sum, the program will provide currently licensed Radiology Technicians in any area of the state the opportunity for a standard education and employers will be assured of high-quality imaging employees.

","The Addiction Studies program prepares students to work with individuals who have substance use disorders and with the family and employer of the chemically dependent person.  The program has a long history of providing education and support to students, some of whom are themselves in recovery, and placing students in internships and jobs in local clinics.
Funds are requested for a detailed study of local employment needs and of what our students do after leaving the program.  Several factors lead to the need for this study.  First, there is increased awareness of the prevalence of mental health issues co-occurring with substance use disorders.  We need to determine whether our current program provides appropriate preparation for current and future practice and make changes if it does not.   Second, there are anecdotal reports of employment churn in local clinics due to the high cost of living in the bay area.  We need to document and understand local employment trends and the employment history of recent students in order to provide accurate career planning and guidance for current and future students.  Finally, in part due to the high cost of living, we recognize that our students have many family and employment responsibilities outside the classroom and may take several years to complete the current program.  We have observed declining enrollment in advanced classes.  To help students persist in the program, we would like to investigate whether smaller “stackable” certificates could lead to early paid employment in local clinics while student work toward completion of the full certificate of achievement or associate degree.",\n,\n,\n
"Outfit fabrication tables with tooling such as clamps, vices, and squares to start implementing the “simulated workplace” in our Fabrication and Industry Training classes.  Install new lighting in these areas and upgrade throughout the shop.  Funding for Skills USA welding and fabrication competitions for students to get real world experience and employment opportunities.  Online resource for our training materials to enhance student access and efficiency.","The first phase in implementing some of the changes made to create a “simulated workplace” to further enhance the job skills students learn from our program.  We find that students learn the science and techniques of welding, but lack some of the fabrication skills needed to secure and keep the jobs available to them.  Last year’s allocation allowed us to set up new workstations, the request in this application would set these workstations up with fabrication tools and lighting.  One of the most common complaints we get from students is the quality of lighting in the welding lab, which makes it more difficult for some of our students to work on projects.  The LED lighting we are proposing would provide lighting of the new workstations as well as replace the old tubes throughout the shop.  These new lights would improve the quality of lighting and also vastly improve energy efficiency while still using the existing fixtures to save on cost.  
 
We are also requesting funding for the Skills USA welding and team fabrication competitions.  This is a nationwide welding competition that gives students real-world experience giving them increased confidence as well as providing direct job opportunities.  American River College has a long history of champions at the state and national levels, but finding funding for this program has become increasingly difficult.

"This program will expand upon the current financial literacy initiatives coordinated by the Financial Aid Office and Financial Literacy Work-group at MiraCosta College.  Providing a more structured and expansive program will allow us to help students develop lifelong skills related to money management, financial planning, reduced student loans and debt management.  The overarching goal would be to effectively develop and  introduce new platforms to deliver this information to students. ","All CE students would benefit from a structured and targeted financial wellness program. CE students in particular are often not eligible for financial aid, increasing their need for financial assistance while completing their courses. Connecting students to resources and giving them the tools to effectively manage their money while in school and during their career is a critical lifelong skill that this program can help develop. According to a recent study from the National Capability Study by the FINRA Foundation, nearly two-thirds of participants could not pass a basic basic financial literacy test that covering aspects of economics and finance encountered in everyday life. Further breaking down the results from the study, 18% of participants from California reported that over the past year their household spent more than their income. The increasing student loan debt in the U.S. is another example of why financial literacy for college students is important. There are 44.5 million student loan (federal and private) borrowers in the U.S., and they owe a collective $1.5 trillion dollars. Out of those borrowers, approximately 4.7 million are in default. Educating students on the options for student loans, smart borrowing strategies, debt management and repayment options is key to their educational and financial success.

"This project seeks to enhance career education students' awareness of, commitment to, and preparation for success in their respective educational programs and career pathways by providing career exploration, counseling, and exposure to careers through industry panels and a CE internship and job fair.  Students' success is positively correlated with their level of knowledge about, confidence in, and commitment to their choice of educational program and related career options.  ","Researcher Virginia Gordon said, “Three out of four students entering the university for the first time have no clear career/occupational goals, and only 8 percent of declared students have an understanding of their majors."" Fellow researchers Orndorf & Herr and Tinto add, ""Even those students who have decided upon a career choice or major still do not have very much information about the specific job they have chosen and this lack of information may also be a source of attrition."" The proposed activities address both of these issues. The outcomes of the project are to increase students' information about their choice of CE program, knowledge of the field they wish to enter, confidence in their ability to interact with employers, and skill in performing the tasks required to successfully obtain internships and professional employment in their respective industries.

"The project is designed to strengthen our department’s advanced course offerings to better prepare our students for industry.  Although our Computer Science program will continue to focus on preparing our students for transfer we see value in creating additional pathways for students, as well as training them for jobs in our industry at the beginning of their CS academic journey.","The project will infuse industry needs and best practices to better prepare our students for the workforce, empowering them to pursue an internship after our courses and/or a job after transferring and attaining a Bachelor’s degree.

The courses that will be renovated to modern standards and innovative practices are as follows:
- CS 134 Mobile App Development course, providing an update to the course curriculum and technologies for students to learn skills necessary for a career path that is in high demand through culturally-sustaining pedagogy. According to Django Paris (2012), culturally sustaining practices challenge educators to develop ways that include and honor their students’ wide range of cultural affiliations.  With this worldview present in the updated CS 134 course, students will employ service learning to create mobile applications serving their community, highlighting and celebrating aspects of their cultural affiliations and helping members of the community.  As many research studies have demonstrated, service-learning is positively associated with persistence, student satisfaction, and a sense of personal success (Vogelgesang, Ikeda, Gilmartin & Keup, 2002).  It is hoped that combining culturally-sustaining pedagogy with service-learning projects will increase the persistence, retention and graduation success of students, including those from disproportionately impacted populations.
- CS 113 Data Structures & Algorithms course, providing hands-on experience with industry-level tools used by software developers and engineers on a day-to-day basis. This will support the intentional addition of software engineering and programming tools that align with the skills needed in the workplace, making our students more employable rather than only focusing on a transfer pathway.
- CS 220 Computer Architecture & Assembly Language course, providing a platform and device to develop computer architecture and assembly programs while using it as a conduit to give students hands-on experience with a prolific industry technology, ARM (Advanced Reduced Instruction Set Computer Machine) architecture and assembly language.

In addition, the project would fund 3 teams (each of 3 students) to participate in ACM’s (Association for Computing Machinery) ICPC (International Collegiate Programming Contest) Southern California Regional contest held at Riverside Community College.  According to CCSSE’s (Community College Survey of Student Engagement) Validation research, “The findings from 20 years of research on undergraduate education have been unequivocal: The more actively engaged students are — with college faculty and staff, with other students, and with the subject matter they study — the more likely they are to learn, to stick with their studies, and to attain their academic goals.”

"Automation is a top industry trend as biomanufacturing companies seek to increase capacity. Surveys indicate industry concern with the inability to hire skilled technical staff. MiraCosta faculty are focused on integrating automation into lecture/laboratory curriculum on bioprocessing monitoring and control. This project will support faculty professional development and equipment purchases to integrate automation into the bachelor's degree program to better prepare students for the workforce.","With the introduction of more FDA-approved therapeutics, biomanufacturing companies are looking for opportunities to increase their capacity, provide consistent product yields, and reduce the time to market. The industry is examining a variety of new technologies to achieve these goals, including the increased use of automation. As recently reported in Bioprocess Online (1), “the need for process optimization, regulatory compliance and supply chain improvements are driving investment in automation technologies across the Life Science industry. As a result, the systems used to automate process steps during the manufacture of pharmaceuticals are evolving rapidly, with new instrumentation and control products coming to market.” These new products will require a highly skilled workforce, who can monitor manufacturing processes in real-time to ensure product quality and safety. 

One large challenge facing the industry, however, is the supply of skilled technical staff to operate these increasingly complex systems. In fact, a 2017 industry survey (2) found that “more than 50% of bioprocessing facilities are experiencing capacity problems this year due to difficulties hiring certain operations staff.” A report in 2016 identified the leading area for hiring in the biomanufacturing industry was in drug production operations representing a third of all planned new hires through 2020 (3). In addition, the same report indicated that hiring professionals for development of production processes is seen as the top hiring challenge by surveyed industry representatives (3). As MiraCosta biotechnology faculty have visited local companies, they have observed firsthand the increase in automated equipment for production and the need for technicians with an understanding of automation fundamentals.

In August 2017, MiraCosta College launched a bachelor’s degree in biomanufacturing. The new program has required the development of 10 upper division courses, including three classes that include a significant laboratory component. The faculty are committed to providing hands-on experiences for students that equip them with the skills and competencies needed to succeed in the local workforce. Since its inception, MiraCosta’s biotechnology program has been valued by industry partners for its emphasis on hands-on training. As the first program in the nation to focus on biomanufacturing for a four-year degree, the upper division curriculum was carefully vetted by industry advisors. Furthermore, faculty continue to communicate with industry professionals to ensure alignment between the classroom and the biomanufacturing workplace. For example, biotechnology department chair Dr. Barbara Juncosa recently completed an industry externship as part of a Strong Workforce funded regional project in the life sciences. Barbara shadowed technicians at six industry sites, which provided valuable insights regarding industry trends including automation.

In the Spring of 2019, the biotechnology department will launch the remaining new courses for the bachelor’s program. These courses will include a lecture/laboratory class on bioprocess monitor and control. The course will cover the measurement, monitoring, modeling, and control of biomanufacturing processes. Given the industry trend towards automation, it is key that MiraCosta students are introduced to automation fundamentals using industry-standard software and hardware to monitor and control manufacturing processes with hands-on activities in the laboratory. The lead instructor for the course is new full-time faculty Waldemar (Wally) Perez, who joined MiraCosta in August 2018 after working for 6 years at the Oceanside Genentech facility where automation is used for the manufacture of next-generation cancer therapies.

To assist Wally with curriculum development and deployment, MiraCosta has partnered with Automated Engineering Services, Inc. (AES) in Oceanside. The president and CEO of AES Leo Castenada personally reached out to MiraCosta in May 2018 to provide his expertise for the course. AES is a top supplier of automation solutions for the life science industry serving companies across the globe. Leo observes firsthand on a daily basis the need for technicians trained in automation fundamentals, as well as the existing workforce gap for these individuals. Seeing the potential impact of our program to address this gap, Leo has committed to providing 100 hours of free consultation (an in-kind donation valued at $20,000), as well as the help of his engineers for equipment installation on our campus. Furthermore, Leo is assisting faculty with negotiating reduced pricing from industry software and equipment vendors to equip the laboratory with a set of student workstations.

The goal of this local Strong Workforce project is to improve student preparation for the biomanufacturing workforce by integrating automation into the bachelor’s program curriculum. This goal will be met by purchasing equipment and industry-standard software for students to create an automated process that involves monitoring and controlling physical and chemical parameters of a solution. This type of experiential learning will be crucial to ensuring that students can translate theoretical concepts into the realities of the biomanufacturing process. By developing a deeper understanding of automation, students will be better positioned to identify and help troubleshoot problems while monitoring and controlling bioprocesses as technicians. In addition, the project will support additional professional development for the lead instructor Wally regarding automation technologies.

Clinical facilities are becoming more difficult to find due to the amount of new programs being developed in the private sector.  Further, hospitals and clinical facilities are reducing the type of placements (i.e. OB, Peds, MedSurg) for the LVN students.  Accreditation requires that students have these clinical experiences.  Also, hospitals are experiencing increased site visits from accreditation entities (i.e. JCAHO), requiring students to return to the skills lab. We have obtained new classrooms in the Chino Education Center to help the program by replacing lost or interrupted clinical sites and to provide our students with a simulated learning environment.

"This project is a mentoring pilot program for Business and Accounting students, providing mentors who have developed successful careers in industry to BUS/ACCT students, with a focus on students from under-served populations.","CE advisory boards have voiced the need for students to be professionally prepared in their fields of study. This challenge can be daunting in an educational environment where many students come from traditionally underserved backgrounds and have not had the opportunity to develop networks that enable them to obtain career advice from a trusted advisor. Often, they enter the workplace, degree/certificate in-hand with no idea how to get beyond the entry level. Formalized mentoring at MiraCosta will provide students access to individuals who can provide them with the guidance and advice needed to advance into a professional role where they can be competitive for jobs, pursue advanced degree programs, and obtain funding for business ventures. This project will support the “more and better” CTE in a variety of ways. Faculty involvement will include the identification, recruitment, and training of mentors and proteges. Through these recruitment efforts, we will strengthen and deepen relationships with industry partners, create opportunities for internships, fill advisory positions, and we will tap into local employers as a source for new enrollments as they become familiar with CE programs and the value of MiraCosta College as a resource for employee development. Students who participate in the program will develop critical professional skills we don’t have time to teach in the class-room; they will learn to “navigate” the workplace (and their careers); and gain access to professionals who have developed successful careers in their field of study. The program will be managed on a daily basis by a project coordinator (likely a classified employee) whose role will primarily be limited to program management, event coordination, and ensuring mentors and proteges connect on a regular basis.

"This project will upgrade the student learning laboratory facilities in the Porter Animal Science Center at Shone Farm to expand career education to include new species, food safety, modern agricultural technologies, animal nutrition and health, and proper management of confined animal facilities. ","The Porter Animal Science Center was designed and constructed in an era where sheep and cattle were the primary livestock operations in Sonoma County; where food safety and environmental concerns were minimal; and where agricultural technology was still exclusively mechanical and analog. In the subsequent decades, the shifting economics of livestock production and changes in consumer preference have introduced poultry (layers and broilers), hogs, goats, and other niche animals into Sonoma County. Environmental and animal welfare standards have also resulted in modified production techniques. New laws and regulations have been implemented, including: the Food Safety Modernization Act; HACCP (Hazard Access Critical Control Point); and the recent extension of statewide water quality regulations for confined animal facilities to small livestock operations. Finally, agricultural technology has evolved considerably in recent decades.

The student learning laboratory facilities in the Porter Animal Science Center at Shone Farm need a major overhaul and upgrade in order to ensure SRJC Animal Science students are learning current, relevant, high-demand skills that will make them employable in a competitive and rapidly-changing livestock production landscape. This SWP project will ensure our Animal Science AS and AST degrees are current, relevant, and prepare students for jobs or further education in the modern livestock industry. We will work with local high schools to develop and market pathways to students so that they will have a broad knowledge of career pathways in agriculture.

"The NOCCD proposes to work with the North Orange County Chamber (NOCC) and with feeder schools throughout the region to develop opportunities for internships and identifying  job training needs.  By connecting business partners from the fields of medicine, advanced manufacturing, business systems and information, and hospitality/tourism with faculty and staff of the NOCCCD, we propose to increase awareness and demand for certificate programs or customized training opportunities.","In May 2018, unemployment in Orange County was at a historically low 2.6% .  This extraordinary number highlights the need for employers to retain and develop current employees.  This presents an opportunity for the NOCCCD to provide access to training and skill development programs through its current curriculum certificate and degree programs as well as customized contract learning.  By enhancing relationships with employers, NOCCCD can seize opportunities for internships and other on the job training needs can be identified with the assistance of the North Orange County Chamber.  Of particular interest are jobs requiring an associate's degree including web developer, medical and clinical laboratory technicians, and physician therapist assistants.  Of further interests are posts-secondary non-graduate training (certificates) including phlebotomist, HVAC mechanic and installer, emergency medical technician, and medical records and health information technician.  Training for these high demand jobs is available through NOCCCD , but the availability of these training programs, particularly in the customized training opportunities, is not well known among those in the business community.  Furthermore, it is well documented that those earning post-secondary credentials and certificates earn more than those with only a high school credential.  ",\n,\n,\n

"Recent changes in the healthcare arena, as well as in today’s technology-oriented healthcare students, require new teaching and learning methodologies, paradigms, and innovative curricula for the delivery of quality education. These changes are further exacerbated in many healthcare programs due to the average experienced educator age being 62.2 years old (AACN Faculty Shortage Sheet, 2017), contributing to the current 7.9% faculty position vacancy rate. For faculty that are recruited and hired ","According to LMI, including a recent report from the Center of Excellence that identifies the Top 100 Middle-Skill Occupations in Riverside County for 2016-2021, the following healthcare careers are listed in order of current and anticipated need: #6-Registered Nurses (5,387 anticipated new jobs); #12-Nursing Assistants (3,898 new jobs); #17-Medical Assistants-2,676 new jobs); #22-Home Health Aides (2,228 new jobs); Licensed Vocational Nurses (1,762 new jobs); # 27-Dental Assistants (1,679 new jobs); and #94-Dental Hygienists (383 new jobs). Further, LMI indicates that job opportunities for Health Specialties Teachers, Postsecondary, are currently high and are expected to grow much faster than the LMI average (see attached), with an employment increase of 28%, or 19,000 available positions, projected by 2024. This data supports the need for professional development, such as this project proposes, to meet the critical labor market needs for well-educated faculty to teach high demand nursing and allied health career students. As Baby Boomer educators continue to retire in the IEDRC, we must ensure we have sufficient numbers of well-trained new faculty to replace them. 

As the new healthcare faculty are trained and supported through the efforts of the proposed Nursing and Allied Health Educator Bootcamp and Support Program, data supports that an immediate impact on the Strong Workforce Program metrics of student retention and completion will be seen in the nursing and allied health students of the affected programs, as well as in the long term impact on the SWF metrics of student enrollment and graduate job placement rates. 

In order to create a viable long term pathway and to continue the premises of this Nursing and Allied Health Educator Bootcamp and Support Program, each college will include one (1) experienced educator as an attendee of the professional development offerings, with the plan being to expand that educator’s theoretical knowledge on the topic of best practices in orientation, development and support of new faculty. Those experienced educators will receive stipends to then carry their knowledge forward to develop a regionally-based bootcamp program that can be offered in the future when this SWF-funded project has concluded.
The program will occur over one (1) academic year and consist of; 1) a two to three (2-3)-day Educator Boot Camp; 2) attendance at regional HWI-sponsored and other available professional development offerings, to include the two (2)-day Innovations in Health Occupations Education Conference offered annually in January; 3) assigned mentors for new faculty with a designated yearly calendar of topics to discuss and set meetings or phone conferences (minimum of four) throughout the academic year; and 4) a culminating experience and program evaluation reception. The initial program will be offered for the 2018/2019 academic year and will be repeated for the 2019/2020 academic year. 

This project does not propose to develop non-credit or credit curriculum for students; however, it does propose that each participating experienced nurse educator from the regional colleges (7 total) will work together to divide up identified boot camp topics and then each develop at least a one-hour segment on their chosen topics. These lessons will be used in future, self-funded, regionally-offered bootcamps when this project has concluded.

"The BESP Consortia project is a response to the Energy Efficiency industry facing serious shortfalls in developing a skilled, trained, and available labor pool. The EC&U sector BESP project responds to sector employer’s needs for a trained and employment ready workforce.  IE/D regional COE data (project TOP codes to SOC Crosswalk LMI) indicate that demand is high. Currently, there are 7336 annual job openings in construction crafts with 1461 annual openings in the high demand well-paying middle-","Inland Empire/Desert region colleges have a significant portfolio of programs related to the energy market transformation, and a number of mechanical and electrical career pathways, many of which need to be upgraded to address emerging competencies in energy efficiency.  This region offers an ideal platform to develop strategies, best practices, and evidence that can be replicated and scaled.

The BESP Consortia project is informed by and has evolved through inputs from industry, policymakers, economic development agencies, faculty and Deans across the region. Colleges that are participating in this initiative offer programs in Process Control, HVACR, Environmental Technologies, Water/Wastewater, Building Automation, Architecture Engineering and Technical drafting technologies, Electronics and Systems Automation, Construction Crafts, Inspection, Welding Technologies, Construction Management and Data Analytics.  

Economic, public policy and labor market research are the primary drivers for this project:
•Annual demand for the target occupations in Riverside and San Bernardino County is 7000+ versus 269 
•New competencies are needed in all target occupations to accommodate industry trends in Energy Efficiency statutory goals and new/retrofitted building code compliance
•Technology is changing the way projects are managed, how materials are produced and the building process itself. The introduction of new technologies has helped to streamline, automate and speed up building design and construction
•Policies and incentives arising from California’s clean energy and pollution reduction mandates continue to accelerate industry’s evolution to automated solutions
•Clean Energy and Pollution Reduction Act of 2015. the Governor has called for a new set of objectives in clean energy, clean air, and pollution reduction for 2030 and beyond. 1) To increase from 33 percent to 50 percent, the procurement of our electricity from renewable sources. (2) To double the energy efficiency savings in electricity and natural gas of retail customers through energy efficiency and conservation.
•Existing Buildings Energy Efficiency Action Plan (EBEE Action Plan) in September 2015. The plan provides a 10-year roadmap to activate market forces and transform California’s existing residential, commercial, and public building stock into high-performing and energy- efficient buildings. 
•Policies and incentives for adoption of energy efficient systems are at the core of California’s strategy for economic growth and competitiveness in the global market

Legislation such as Proposition 39 and Title 24 (CA Building Code) continues to create new jobs by infusing hundreds of millions of dollars annually in energy efficient buildings and by incentivizing new private investments. New technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Direct Digital Control, Smart Sensors, Analytics, evolving HVACR and environment and control systems, Automated Building Controls, and Artificial Intelligence dominate the way buildings and processes must respond to these drivers.    In addition to the supply/demand and new worker competency gaps, multiple studies show a massive need to upskill the incumbent workforce. 

The foundation of the EC&U sustainability project is the “Expert Network” of willing and engaged cross-sector Faculty Champions that fosters a channel for industry-driven competencies, common outcomes, stackable credentials and credit transportability across regional colleges. The expert network develops as a learning community which thru collaboration and innovation transform the regional programs. Advancing student success by aligning content and outcomes with third-party evidence-based benchmarks and assessments leading to industry valued credentials. Exploring and implementing work experience and internship programs.  Recognizing existing demands on faculty, this project assists in curriculum alignment and development by funding consultants to work at the direction of faculty.  It also provides funding for adjunct instructors and guest lecturers to deliver specialized content modules that are infused into existing courses and programs. Professional development opportunities and access to available online and virtual training and assessment program augmentation tools. 

The Sustainability Pathways has a primary focus of engaging and expanding an existing Industry Advisory comprised of the Association Energy Engineers, Siemens, Johnson Controls, Honeywell, ABM, Association of Air Conditioning Contractors (ACCA) ASHRAE, International Facilities Management Association, So California Edison, UA250, Operating Engineers local 501, and others with a strong presence in the county.   Significant contributions to this advisory are being made by UC Davis, the Southern California HVACR Collaborative, and the National Science Foundation BEST Center.

This initiative includes: 
•Alignment of student learning outcomes across the region’s programs
•Transfer of certificate or degree-level credits across participating colleges
•Convening and sustaining an Expert Network that engages industry in faculty planning
•Professional development for faculty, aligned with industry priorities
•A community of practice for sharing curricula and building evidence for replication and scaling
•Engagement of consultants to support faculty in curriculum alignment and development
•Assessment of outcomes and continuous improvement of processes
•Opportunities for braided funding enhancement thru Prop 39, Projects in Common and SWP Local share investments and leveraging multiple funding streams for investment i.e equipment, etc.


What is BESP?
There are sixteen BESP specialties that are directly related to high demand jobs for California’s advanced energy workforce.  The names for the specialties should be consistent, but do not necessarily need to be the same as the individual certificate names.  This is important because every college will have different names for similar energy efficiency related certificates and the courses will vary by name, number, and scope.  To control this, program learning outcomes (PLO’s) will be tied to a select IRC for each specialty with those competencies reflected in the student learning outcomes (SLO’s) for the individual courses.
All courses outside of the ZNE core are elective and provide students the ability to pick the courses they need for their specialty, career, job upgrade, or other need while completing their degree.  Additionally, the courses are overlaid to encourage stacking.  Many of the advanced energy related certificates contain duplicate courses depending on each college’s curriculum, so providing the overlay helps students decide the most efficient and effective approach to multiple certificates within the BESP program.
The state recognized BESP program model has an unlimited number of available courses including entrepreneurial courses which make up the (18 unit) BESP Entrepreneurship Track.  This degree track is for energy students who want to start a business in their field of study.  Ideally any college could adopt all or some of these existing courses and begin instruction immediately if they have existing courses already on the books for similar certificates.  This would be accomplished by aligning SLO’s and PLO’s to meet the industry standards and then adding their course to the elective list under each specialty.
The goal for the Building and Energy Systems Professional, Associate of Science Degree (BESP) is to provide the student with the entry level skills, knowledge, and industry driven competencies to successfully enter and succeed in the Building Science and Advanced Energy Systems fields.

"LAUNCH exists to remove the obstacles faced by education and industry partners using the apprenticeship model and to present a ready-made product that employers and students can engage today.  Combining technical assistance and key talent, program and service alignment, shared messaging, broader service reach, and expansive partnerships, LAUNCH gives the region a comprehensive solution that empowers institutions, students, and employers to create dynamic stackable credentialing programs that tar","Expanding the apprenticeship model beyond its current form is a difficult but worthy task. For every 1,000 apprentices we support, estimates indicate we could increase wage earning in our region by $240,037,000 over the career-span of those individuals. In addition, because they link individuals directly with employment, apprenticeships deter youth unemployment and increase youth labor force participation. In Riverside and San Bernardino County, teens have been employed at only half the rate of the national average and the employment rate for those 20 to 24 is also lagging.  Apprenticeship provides a solution because it educates and concurrently employs individuals towards living-wage careers. For example, the effective apprenticeship system in Switzerland - where many teens secure apprenticeships embedded within their schooling–has resulted in a youth unemployment rate below four percent.    Essentially, our job isn’t simply to make apprenticeship work for our colleges, our job is to make apprenticeship work for our region and its industries.  
In the past several years, apprenticeship has received popular attention in addition to federal, state and private investment.  Hundreds of millions of dollars have been invested nationwide with the expressed purpose of expanding apprenticeship into new industries and occupations.  However, progress remains slow and questions regarding long-term sustainability remain unanswered for many newly created programs.  Urban Institute fellow Robert Lerman – who has written extensively on apprenticeships in the U.S. and internationally – has emphasized the need for funding to target the development of a robust and sustainable apprenticeship system instead of focusing on individual programs.   For proof of the effectiveness of this strategy we can look to states like South Carolina, which increased from 90 apprenticeship programs in 2007 to 918 programs today, and increased their active apprentice count from 777 to 14,475.   Colleges should particularly note South Carolina’s success because a pillar of the state’s “Divisional Approach” remains the full participation of the 16 technical colleges that have integrated the apprenticeship model and provide training and education to the region’s workforce.
While institutions and employers have shown an interest in the apprenticeship model, they have faced a multitude of obstacles including bureaucratic complexities, lack of awareness, high upfront costs with slow growth projections, and lack of sustainable funding options.  To put it simply, apprenticeship seems to confuse the people (employers and students) that would benefit from it most.  For example, if a students came in to your department and asked how they could start an apprenticeship, what response(s) would they receive?  Meanwhile, countless employers are asking for a workforce that can show up on time, be ready to work, with the ability to learn.  We can provide a solution that combines work-based learning with continued education and answers an immediate need for employers, but the method needs to clear and simple, and the value needs to be shown up front.
LAUNCH represents the first largescale regional apprenticeship network in the state of California that seeks to build the necessary infrastructure for the expansion of apprenticeship and work-based learning.  We can learn valuable lessons from other models such as Apprenticeship Carolina, a Division of the SC Technical Colleges, the Technical College System of Georgia’s apprenticeship programs, and private collaborations like the Jackson Area Manufacturing Association.  We can also improve upon those models by leveraging unique and substantial California advantages.  The most significant lesson taught by all of these, however, is that collaboration through a regional approach is critical to the success of apprenticeship and work-based learning.
HOW IT WORKS:
Participating colleges will serve different functions within LAUNCH, but will work together to accomplish the following: 
•	Supporting cost-effective methods and strategizing sustainability for seven individual colleges developing and registering apprenticeship programs among five districts, with expansion strategies for colleges not participating in this round.
o	Colleges participating as “Program sponsors” will be supported through program development according to the structure and model that best aligns with their college.  Having local control over program structure allows individual colleges to leverage funding and personnel strength while building their program.
-	Key Talent and technical assistance allows the bulk of funding to be used when programs are up-and-running, and it saves up-front costs through the course of administrative processes and approvals.
-	Programs will strategize and demonstrate sustainability through enrollment growth and the braiding of funds.
•	Targeting immediate industry needs in priority labor sectors (apprenticeships = jobs)
-	College programs will be structured to respond to immediate industry needs and build long term strategies for identifying and infusing growing industry sectors.
•	Facilitate the alignment of programs supporting apprenticeships in shared industries and occupations.
-	Aligning programs in similar occupations is critical for industry engagement.  Participating colleges with work to align “work-processes” and skills for the purposes of tracking work-based learning.  This allows for greater mobility of participating employers and students, and establishes industry recognized terms and more portable credentials.
-	In addition, aligning work-processes and skills in like occupations allows programs to aggregate the demand for certain skillsets.
•	Aligning and simplifying user interfaces so that employers and apprentices experience the same streamlined services and processes across the network.
-	Programs will work to align user interfaces so that apprenticeship experiences become common and streamlined.  In other words, colleges will work together to establish streamlined processes and procedures so employers and students know what to expect when starting and completing an apprenticeship.  Program and interface alignment allows regional employers to participate in the network without needing to learn individual college nuances.
-	In addition, common interfaces allows colleges not participating in the network to enter with lower upfront costs as much of the product development will be complete.
•	Marketing apprenticeship regionally – providing students with a clear and viable pathway through a career, and employers with a clear effective method to develop their existing workforce.
-	Participating colleges will work together on shared messaging and marketing practices that promote apprenticeship and work-based learning within the region.
•	Broadening partnerships with regional stakeholders (i.e. high schools, WDBs, etc.) and distributing best practices and sharing resources where appropriate and beneficial.
-	Focusing on partnerships with regional stakeholders, such as high schools, WDBs, employer/industry associations, etc., participating colleges will deepen workforce & economic development strategies to provide more and better CTE.
-	LAUNCH will work together to develop and distribute best practices for colleges wishing to use apprenticeship in the region.
-	As programs continue to align learning objectives and services, shared resources, such as apprenticeship tracking software, will be considered and vetted by the apprenticeship network.  Again, with the intent to lower the cost of apprenticeship programs and deliver better quality to employers and students.
Roles & Functions of Participating Colleges:
There are four major roles individual colleges will play within LAUNCH:
1)	Project Lead, Key Talent, Technical Assistance, and Project Administration:
a.	Norco College will provide LAUNCH with support and technical assistance in completing the objectives listed above.  In addition, Norco College will function as the lead and will maintain administrative support for the project. 
2)	Developers and Drivers:
-	Some colleges have committed to driving the development of new programs, building new industry partnerships, serving as education providers, and function as program sponsors.  Outreach to businesses is a major focus of this group, and colleges selecting this role also plan to support regional aspects of apprenticeship – such as aligning programs and procedures with other colleges and process improvement in general.
The following colleges have committed to this role:
1.	San Bernardino Valley College
2.	Mt. San Jacinto College
3.	Chaffey College
4.	Norco College
3)	Program Sponsors:
-	Some colleges in LAUNCH have committed to serve both as education providers and program sponsors, but will not be primarily focused on program development.  Program sponsors fulfill an administrative role in apprenticeship that requires the college to complete employer acceptance agreements, track and monitor on-the-job training, liaison and submit records to apprenticeship agencies, and oversee apprenticeship agreements.
The following colleges have committed to this role:
1.	Barstow Community College
2.	College of the Desert
3.	Crafton Hills College
4)	Education Providers:
-	LAUNCH will also include colleges that wish to participate primarily as education providers within the network.  This means that they will accommodate registered apprentices enrolling in existing programs and courses, but they do not intend to administrate apprenticeships or handle employer agreements/contracts.  In addition, they will remain informed of new programs under development that align with their curriculum.
The following colleges have committed to this role:
1.	Copper Mountain College
2.      Moreno Valley College",\n,\n,\n
"The Inland Empire CyberHub Centers project will establish a multi-college, regional cyber-security support network that will help the region to build strong cyber-security career pathways for students. The region has existing cyber-security programs that will be strengthened and expanded with the creation of Inland Empire (IE) CyberHub centers. Colleges not currently offering cyber-security courses and pathways will be able to expand into this subject area with the help and support of the region","Think cyber crime is something only found in fiction? Think again, because online crime is a very real threat in our Internet-connected society. With 1.5 million annual cyber-attacks, online crime is a real threat to anyone on the Internet. That number means there are over 4,000 cyber-attacks every day, 170 attacks every hour, or nearly three attacks every minute (www.Forbes.com ).  It's no secret that cyber-attacks are on the increase.  Each day there seems to be a new report of a corporation being hacked or having a data breach including some prominent companies that including Sony, Target, Equifax and many more. Most of us have had our own experience of being hacked or having personal information stolen. The ISACA, a non-profit information security advocacy group, predicts there will be a global shortage of two million cyber-security professionals by 2019. Every year in the U.S., 40,000 jobs for information security analysts go unfilled, and employers are struggling to fill 200,000 other cyber-security related roles, according to cyber security data tool CyberSeek. And for every ten cyber-security job ads that appear on careers site Indeed, only seven people even click on one of the ads, let alone apply.

Our educational system is simply not producing enough skilled workers to meet the current demand. This need is soaring and expected to grow exponentially over the next decade.  The Inland Empire Desert Region community colleges need to better position themselves to meet this need and provide adequate training to students so they will be prepared to fill some of the workforce demand. Embedding the Cyberhubs into regional makerspace locations and existing Cyber centers will provide easily accessible places for the community colleges to work with partners from our secondary schools, ROPs, community based agencies and business partners.
Cyber-security workers protect our most important and private information, from bank accounts to sensitive military communications. However, there is a dangerous shortage of trained cyber-security workers in the United States that puts our digital privacy and infrastructure at risk.

In 2016 there were 112,000 openings for Information Security Analysts, but only 96,870 workers currently employed in those positions – an annual talent shortfall of over 15,000 workers for cyber-security’s largest job.

There are 200,000 additional openings requesting cyber-security-related skills, and employers are struggling to find workers who possess them. Jobs requesting cloud security skills, for example, remain open 96 days on average – longer than any other IT skill.

This proposal will establish a multi-college, regional cyber-security support network and will allow each participating college to have a CyberHub center to support students and faculty for both technology and cyber-security. Capitalizing on program success promotes the creation of additional Cyberhubs.  Incorporating a Cyberhub into a makerspace provides valuable hands-on learning opportunities for students seeking employment in a cyber-security career pathway. It also provides access to economically disadvantaged students and nontraditional students that may not otherwise have access to cyber-security education, training and activities including summer camps and team competitions. This model will also allow the community colleges to increase access to high school and middle school students creating a pathway from middle school to the community college and beyond – whether that is to a college or university or directly into employment. Partners from secondary schools and community based agencies will also reap benefits from the CyberHub centers. The centers will provide ideal locations for cyber events including competitions, practices and summer camps. This will help to build strong pathways between high schools and community colleges and increase the number of students who persevere in their pursuit of a cyber-security career.",\n,\n,\n
"The data and analytics project will bridge data sources between the participating colleges, institutional effectiveness and the local Centers of Excellence to ensure validated data aligns across the region. Staff will also conduct student surveys to report student goals, which will in turn help with enrollment and completion data for Strong Workforce.  ","Every Strong Workforce application is based on metrics including enrollment, completion, and job opportunities and earnings.  Each college struggles to secure this information, especially since MIS data is one year behind in reporting.  Additionally, each college struggles tracking local certificate completions, and how their respective alumni are doing.  This project provides each participating college with a dedicated staff member to provide the required data for our Strong Workforce decision making.  These college staff will work collaboratively with dedicated COE staff to provide each college discipline specific data.  ",\n,\n,\n
"We will map MOSs, Ratings, and AFSCs to CTE programs within 3 districts, allowing us to issue guaranteed college credits to veterans before they apply to the college. Subsequently, we will develop a statewide, public, searchable, “militaryassist.org” solution, building the database needed to sustain a national military-to-college articulation platform, including a training crosswalk for any community college interested in implementing the model. ","All veterans leave the military with a MOS, Rating or AFSC, depending on their branch. These classifications are associated with each veterans’ job in the military and the corresponding training. 
At the Spring 2011 plenary session, delegates from the Academic Senate for California Community Colleges passed Resolution 18.04 that urged local senates to apply credit for educational experiences during military service toward the associate degree – including the fulfillment of general education, major coursework, certificates, and other degree requirements – in accordance with the recommendations listed in the American Council on Education (ACE) Guide to the Evaluation of Educational Experiences in the Armed Services. Giving veterans due credit for their military experience will result in more veterans graduating from our colleges more quickly, and will help ensure the success of our veterans at our public postsecondary educational institutions.

However, while colleges are allowed to grant college credit for military work experience and training, no public college or university has established a thorough and comprehensive articulation process communicating to veterans in advance how many units they will receive at a given institution. Under our current system, veterans wishing to demonstrate comparable skills and understanding of course content must first apply to a specific college and then undergo a manual and cumbersome evaluation process only to then learn how many credits that institution will grant them for their military training and education. This process usually results in credits that fulfill few, or no, requirements for the degree beyond counting toward the minimum number elective credits – all because of inadequate articulation services. This is a national embarrassment and we are going to fix this here in the Inland Empire.

In most cases, a veteran’s military specialty is a career & technical education area. The Inland Empire Regional Consortium of Community Colleges can become more “veteran friendly” in the acceptance of academic credit, increase veteran enrollment in CTE programs, and increase the number of CTE program completers by doing the following:
1)	Ensuring all our college’s establish a policy to award credit for military coursework at the appropriate level as recommended by the ACE guide. 
2)	Evaluate and publish in advance the alignment between a veterans’ military education/training/experience and CCC coursework, organized by college, to identify military credit that may fulfill CTE certificate/degree requirements. 

By spring 2018, we will hire 4 dedicated CTE Veteran Articulation officers and a Project Director to map MOSs, Ratings and AFSCs to CTE programs across three colleges/districts with a distinct focus (Crafton Hills – emergency & public safety, Norco – engineering/computing technologies, San Bernardino Valley College - aeronautics/automotive/diesel, and MSJC - healthcare), allowing us to issue guaranteed college-credit communication to veterans before they apply to our colleges. In the fall of 2018, we will start the processes of mapping military experience and training to all CTE programs in each college’s entire catalog.  Once we have completed our internal processes, we will develop a national solution, similar to assist.org, building the database needed to sustain a national military-to-college articulation platform. This project shall include professional development and assistance for any regional community college interested in participating and implementing the model. There is widespread confirmation of this need among prominent military groups (CalVet and VA) for a “militaryassist.org” website. The SWP subgroup believes this will directly impact the pathway of military veterans into CTE programs positively raising CTE enrollments and CTE program completions.",\n,\n,\n
"This proposal is a request to develop and implement a Cloud-Hosted Regional NETLAB+.  NETLAB+ is a virtual lab management and scheduling appliance that provides students with the ability to access virtual lab sessions from any location with high-speed internet access. Traditionally it is used across the California Community Colleges for Information Technology and Cyber-security training however, with its custom lab creation tool, it can also be used to create virtual labs for any curriculum requ","There is strong interest and support among faculty for a cloud-based learning environment. Existing on-site equipment cannot support expanding resources to other areas needing technology.  A cloud-based system is capable of supporting traffic and workload of a greater student body. Execution of this proposal would be nearly seamless, with only negligible tweaking of lesson plans, operations and resource administration.

Information & Communications Technologies (ICT) and digital media industry groups in the Inland Empire/Desert region demonstrate positive projected job growth from 2018 to 2020. The computer systems design and related services industry group had the most jobs in the region in recent years.  Employment opportunities  for the ICT group is expected to grow 28% in the next few years, adding around 100 jobs by 2020 and having average earnings of more than $101,000 per year.

Significant efficiencies would result from a cloud configuration. At present, software licenses assigned to a specific piece of hardware, which may be in-use, but not using all software licensed to it. With virtualization, licenses are per user, as opposed to individual, pieces of physical equipment. This allows for much greater sharing and utilization of licenses. Consequently, software-licensing costs in cloud environment are between 1/10th and 1/30th of current expenditures for physical labs.

Under this proposal, limited deployment allows for the establishment of procedures, formation of advisory teams, further development of curriculum and future decisions to move forward with a broader migration. Implementation also allows for establishment of security policies and permission/privilege hierarchy, crucial to integrity of operations across any future expansion of VLAB services to additional campuses, regions or region-wide.

Benefits to the colleges through implementation of this proposal include:
•	Expanded Course Offerings
•	Increased Leverage with Vendors
•	Expedited Deployment of New Courses
•	Heightened Status as Provider of Current Technology Training
•	Rapid scalability
•	24/7 Access and Maintenance
•	Large Library of Lab Resources
•	Simulations on a Larger Scale
•	Resource Sharing
•	Lower Cost-Per-Student
•	Security Isolation",\n,\n,\n

There aren't any known AM programs in the community college system. dvance Manufacturing Pathways - Engineering Technologies Technicians (AMP-ETT) project addresses the Southern California's need for training Skilled workers, hiring and placing them through Apprenticeship and internship programs. Advance Manufacturing is a regionally prioritized sector and by including the Apprenticeship component to it will streamline the Middle Skilled workers' hiring through work based learning within the Advance Manufacturing priority sector industries. 
These programs serves 2 objectives, first the need for trained Nationally and Industry certificated CTE workers and second as an accredited transferable program for the educational upward mobility of the workforce in the region.
The stackable programs start with no prerequisites or placement requirements and teaches based on the ""Just In Time Teaching"" to fill in the gaps needed in Geometry, Math and English. As the students move toward the AS degree, the rigor of the program strengthens and the required C-ID courses such as Calculus (Math 145), Physics (PHYS 105), Chemistry (Chem 110) and General education Courses are taken during the last year.
To start the Pathways, any Incumbent worker or anyone looking for a new career in Advance Manufacturing and Engineering Technology would be be able to join these programs with an upward technical mobility leading to social and economical mobility, also as they get their Certificates they would go through paid and unpaid internships and Strong Workforce Apprenticeship Program (SWAG). SWAG is a State funded program to help the employers reduce the cost of training their workers and certifying them through SWAG or the partner Community College programs. 
A Strong capacity exists in the Engineering and Technologies Department due to the Engineering Graphics & Design Technology (EGD-TEK) program thats brings in approximately a cohort of 150 students per year only on the ELAC campus not including the Career Pathways from High Schools.
To develop these programs an extensive research has been done on the available programs in the 2-years and 4-years institutions and the finding are: 
- There are no Community Colleges in the So. Cal. that has CTE Engineering Technology programs in Advance Manufacturing that trains the students and plans to place them in the job market. 
- Only Cal Poly Pomona and CSU Long Beach have the accreditation from Accreditation Board of Engineering and Technology (ABET) in Engineering Technology programs. 
All 3 Engineering Technology programs in Advance Manufacturing, Mechanical and Industrial Engineering Technologist programs are designed based on the ABET accreditation, which makes the articulation and transfer process easier.

"This project supports six Air Force Association’s (AFA) CyberCamps, including at least one advanced camp, for middle and high school students at community colleges in the Greater Sacramento Region at no cost to the students or their families.  These camps are one of the region’s primary tools for recruiting middle and high school students into Cybersecurity programs offered at our community colleges.","Following several successful camps during previous summers, a team of local educators, spearheaded by the Deputy Sector Navigator for Information & Communication Technologies and Digital Media, once again plans to operate 13 Air Force Association’s (AFA) CyberCamps, including four advanced camps, for middle and high school students at community colleges in the Greater Sacramento Region at no cost to the students or their families. This proposal seeks support for 13 AFA Summer CyberCamps at $6,000 per camp to make this possible.
The AFA created the CyberCamp initiative “to continue to inspire students to pursue STEM related activities outside of the school year” (http://uscyberpatriot.org/special-initiatives/afa-cybercamp-program/program-overview) and has continuously refined the curriculum over the past several years of successful participation by tens of thousands of youths across the nation. The camps will be held at community colleges in our region during the summer of 2019, CyberCamp attendees will learn valuable Cybersecurity skills and become familiar with community college campuses, and parents, guardians, and siblings will have the opportunity to attend a Family Day to learn more about Computing careers and basic Cybersecurity procedures at home and at work.
To help coordinate these efforts my team once again includes the director of the Elk Grove Unified School District (EGUSD)’s CyberPatriot Center of Excellence (http://uscyberpatriot.org/Pages/COEs/Elk-Grove-USD.aspx) along with several regional CyberPatriot mentors, coaches, and Cybersecurity instructors. We expect that the AFA CyberCamps will continue to facilitate community college outreach to feeder high schools, many of which already support student teams that participate in the AFA’s CyberPatriot competition for middle school and high school students. By once again offering Advanced CyberCamps to students who have previously completed a Standard camp, we expect to further develop especially those students’ interest in pursuing careers in Computing-related fields, and especially in Cybersecurity, and their familiarity with Cybersecurity programs at our region’s community colleges. 
Each CyberCamp would allow about 30 high school students to experience the AFA’s CyberCamp Program 20-hour curriculum during a week of four-hour morning or afternoon sessions. I expect that most of the instructors, instructional assistants, organizing team members, and host colleges who participated in 2018 will once again open their doors in 2019, and I hope to expand the program to at least one more community college in the region. Regional K-12 collaborators continue to confirm demand for such camps, and with an increased marketing effort we expect to fill all camps and work from waiting lists as necessary to fill any spots should become available. Our team will continue to work with the California Department of Education to share the dates and times of the CyberCamps on a central clearinghouse website for Sacramento.
The CyberPatriot initiative continues to be our region’s primary tool for recruiting middle and high school students into the Cybersecurity programs offered at our community colleges.
Our region’s ICT/DM Sector team once again plans to offer Summer CyberCamps to help build enrollments in the Cybersecurity programs offered by our region’s community colleges, to increase the number of qualified Cybersecurity workers, and to raise awareness for the need of secure computing in the Greater Sacramento Region.",\n,\n,\n

To launch the new program, a seasoned, knowledgeable advisor must shepherd the process for the 1st two years and lead the program through the accreditation site visit and self-st","Upon the College's decision to revitalize the dental program, two experts were hired to work with the existing faculty to write the new COR, syllabus, and course materials to CODA's standards, in collaboration with the program advisory committee.  Further, CODA required the hiring of an additional faculty, and the search is being completed with this individual slated to start fall, 2018.  The program anticipates a new incoming cohort Jan 2019, but that cohort will need to be scheduled, and need to have an accelerated summer session  overseen.  Further, the program director needs to put into place assessment processes (as required by CODA) and assess the new curriculum for meeting CODA's requirements.  The new curriculum is substantively more complex and rigorous than the previous material, particularly in the biological sciences, and the director will need to address this in the site visit. In essence, the director must launch the program, assess the new curriculum, revise as necessary, write a self-study for the follow-up site visit, lead the site visit from CODA, and make any necessary changes as an outcome of the visit.  This cannot be done alone by the new faculty, and the existing faculty is not qualified to complete these tasks. As there is not a qualified faculty in place to complete the next step of revitalization, the program must have an outside individual mentor the role until the new faculty is fully matriculated into the College and ready to assume the role of director solo and the CODA issues have been resolved.

"1) Launch a Construction Management program at Citrus College. An outgrowth of a preexisting Public Works curriculum, construction management is the application of processes, methods, knowledge, skills and experience to achieve successful project outcomes.  2) Expand current diesel program to include training in stationary power generation.  3) The Architecture Department seeks accreditation from the Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture as a community college candidate member. ","1) Construction Management:
Based on the data, the COE has determined that there is an unmet need for an additional construction management program in the region. Reasons include: • In Los Angeles County, only one community college trains students in civil and construction management technology. • The entry-level hourly earnings for construction managers in Los Angeles County are $13.60 per hour – slightly higher than the living wage for one adult in the county. • Construction managers typically require a bachelor’s degree as the entry-level education. However, a third of the existing workforce, has completed some postsecondary coursework. • In 2017, there were nearly 12,000 ads for construction management related jobs in Los Angeles County.  Diesel engine specialty areas are an in-demand, high wage opportunities. 

2) Stationary Power Generation:
The latest projections from O-net online estimate that 28,200 jobs in the area of diesel engine specialists will open from 2016-2026. Median wages are estimated to be in on the average of $45,170 which according to the latest report from LAEDC is higher than the median income of $35,015. Career-one- stop projects a 21% change from 2014 to 2024 with an annual projected job opening number of 850. To fill this gap, the project intends to expand on key elements of the MTRK program’s diesel engine curriculum and put in place the necessary equipment and provide the latest training to offer a robust training experience in the area of diesel engine stationary power generation.

3) Architecture:
Architectural and engineering firms help design buildings, bridges, road and water infrastructure, and renewable energy projects in Southern California, as well as across the United States and overseas. Downtown Los Angeles is experiencing a major revitalization that will continue to spur more construction. Major projects are being planned in the San Gabriel and Santa Clarita valleys, as well as in the eastern and northern portions of Los Angeles County. The LAEDC and Center for Competitive Workforce reports that the need for Professional. Scientific, and Technical Services is expected to grow 5.7% by 2021.

The fulfillment of these needs would align with SWP priorities such   as maximizing sustained industry engagement, strengthening career pathways and programs of study in partnership with K- 12 school districts, increased opportunities for work-based learning, attending to the need of professional development, addressing the needs of business and supporting regional marketing and curriculum alignment.",\n,\n,\n

Among these activities are our annual counselor conference and sector-based activities and programs.   ","Regional needs: Employers have difficulty filling jobs due to a lack of qualified applicants. Employers report that students do not have the needed work readiness skills or soft skills. These skills can include adaptive, analysis/solution mindset, collaboration, communication, digital fluency, an entrepreneurial mindset, empathy, resilience, self-awareness, and social/diversity awareness. 

There is no regional articulation of Career Education (CE) courses and programs, although there is articulation across some high school and community college partners. The San Diego/Imperial region has developed some career pathways through the SB 1070 CE Regional Pathways work and through two CCPT grants working to develop career pathways in specific sectors. However, not all programs offer work-based learning or integrate work readiness into the coursework. Students get different levels of access to programs across the region, depending on where they live. Because there is considerable student mobility around the region, it is critical that students have portable credentials and courses so that they can continue on their pathway if they have to change schools.



Through previous Regional Strong Workforce efforts, the SDIC Consortium contracted with WestEd to research and analyze the current status of career pathways and employment readiness in the region. Their research and analysis revealed that while students are persisting in individual courses, they are not completing full pathways within their selected career area. Only 34 percent enroll in aligned course in subsequent terms, and 13 percent remain within the pathway across any of the colleges within the SDIC region. WestEd noted that the populations of San Diego and Imperial Counties and their community college students have pressing needs for robust, differentiated instructional and support services to ensure student persistence and long-term success:
•	Over one-third of the population in the region lives at or near poverty levels.
•	34 percent of the population over 25 (over 750,000 adults) holds a high school diploma or less.
•	46 percent of community college students are over the age of 25; 32 percent are between the ages of 20-24; and 22 percent are age 19 or less. This youngest group appears to be growing.
•	Approximately 38 percent of students in the region are “first generation” college students.
•	Across the ten colleges, 5 to 38 percent of students took one or more credit or noncredit ESL courses.

Approach to address needs. WestEd noted that the “Guided Pathways” approach can help support student success and equitable outcomes — whether certificates, employment, or transfer — by providing structured course sequences, careful intake and planning processes, rich learning opportunities, and robust support services. At the core of this approach is fundamental reconfiguration of the college experience that focuses on student needs and provides “intrusive” or proactive direction that guides students to completion and success. Three regional colleges are currently working with the California Guided Pathways project to develop guided pathways. 

There are four pillars in the guided pathways approach: clarify the path; enter the path; stay on the path; ensure learning. WestEd recommended adding a fifth pillar – employment preparation and transitions – to augment Guided Career Pathways.  Rather than working with a subset of students, Guided Pathways is a college wide undertaking that provides a framework for integrating all of the California-based initiatives focused on the student journey. Regional approaches, especially for business engagement processes, can enhance alignment of the Guided Pathways approach with Strong Workforce goals. 

Through their research WestEd identified several key system components as critical for student success in college, employment, further education, and long-term careers. These components are closely aligned with those supported by the Guided Pathways initiative, with additional emphasis on career-related experiences and employment services. The key system components include:

•	Pre-enrollment engagement: activities conducted prior to matriculation with prospective students to facilitate enrollment, and aid in their understanding of the educational options, pathways, and services available. 

•	Matriculation and comprehensive assessment: the process of enrolling in a community college and completing the necessary assessments and plans to pursue a pathway. 

•	Career exploration: a process of learning about career options through workshops, classes, tours, career-related research projects, informational interviews, and job shadows, based on identified interests and goals.

•	Pathway participation and career preparation: engagement with the courses and experiences offered in a career pathway. 

•	Career planning before education planning: development of a career plan, which includes a student’s interests, skills, and values, the career options that the student is interested in pursuing, and the educational and work-related experiences that will lead to one or more long-term career goals. 

•	Education planning: development of an education plan, which includes the documentation of the courses needed for a student to complete a specific degree, certificate, or transfer program of study and fulfill their educational goals, both at the community college level and beyond.


•	Applied and work-based learning (WBL): strategies that deepen learning and support career awareness, career exploration, and career preparation through engagement with employers and real work opportunities. 

•	Student supports: the full range of services needed to successfully complete pathways including tutoring, testing for special education, peer study groups, assessment and accessibility supports for students with disabilities, and nonacademic supports for personal needs such as just-in-time housing services, transportation and parking, food and nutrition, child care, financial assistance, and other subsidies. 

•	Employment preparation and transition: activities that prepare students to transition into further education, formal training, and/or the workforce such as resume writing, interview skills, job search services, letters of recommendation, and feedback and coaching opportunities.

This project addresses the pre-college component of the Guided Career Pathways, including career exploration, career planning before educational planning. Project 2 addresses the college-based components of Guided Career Pathways.  

Through previous grants, the Region has a strong history of providing robust career engagement and exploration activities for middle and high school students and faculty.  In fiscal 2018-19, the staff will offer more than 1,000 students in the region access to CE engagement activities with college and industry guidance. Regional staff partner with DSNs and college faculty to create and implement these activities.

To address these recommendations, in Round 3 the SDIC region will undertake three main activities as part of this pre-college engagement project:

(1) A gap analysis of and updated approach to middle, high and adult school engagement activities.   Implement an updated schedule of pre-college engagement activities. 

(2)  Develop regional career pathways goals and middle/high goals and associated leading indicators. 

(3) Provide Professional development for K-14 counselors and faculty.

"In 2017 WestEd analyzed the region’s current status in career pathways and employment readiness and recommended developing Guided Career Pathways. As a result of this analysis and related recommendations, the SDIC region will undertake five implementation activities: 

1.	Improved Student Pathway Navigation
2.	Work-based Learning Coordination and 21st Century Skills Transfer
3.	Employer Engagement
4.	Job Placement Case Management
5.	Faculty Professional Development
","Regional needs: Employers have difficulty filling jobs due to a lack of qualified applicants. Employers report that students do not have the needed job readiness skills or soft skills. These skills can include adaptive, analysis/solution mindset, collaboration, communication, digital fluency, an entrepreneurial mindset, empathy, resilience, self-awareness, and social/diversity awareness. 

Each college has its own career services system, which is usually isolated from course content, educational planning and CE leadership. Many community college students do not access career planning and guidance services until they are close to leaving the institution, whether by graduation or by deciding to leave to pursue work. Each college in the region offers some career services which may include career exploration materials and counselors available to students who make their way to the office to seek assistance. Colleges may offer in-person individual and group career counseling. Colleges may also offer a series of job fairs and workshops each semester on career exploration and related topics. In addition, most colleges provide access to online career exploration information and materials on their websites. Many also provide access to online workshops on a range of topics. 

In many majors, students must initiate career planning; it is not always integrated into their CE coursework. Most community college career services require the student to initiate the job search, rather than having career exploration and workplace skills development integrated into the institution's CE courses and ongoing student planning and information systems. Because many students attend more than one institution, students need to be able to transport their career and educational plans among the region's colleges.

Although most colleges also offer links to internship search sites, there is no central site for internships and job placement; employers may be contacted by many different people from across the region looking for placements. Although the career center and CE programs may have leads on some local internship opportunities, the student is often left to find the actual internship on their own. 

In 2017 the SDIC Consortium contracted with WestEd to research and analyze the current status of career pathways and employment readiness in the region. Their research and analysis revealed that while students are persisting in individual courses, they are not completing full pathways within their selected career area. Only 34 percent enroll in aligned course in subsequent terms, and 13 percent remain within the pathway across any of the colleges within the SDIC region. WestEd noted that the populations of San Diego and Imperial Counties and their community college students have pressing needs for robust, differentiated instructional and support services to ensure student persistence and long-term success:
•	Over one-third of the population in the region lives at or near poverty levels.
•	34 percent of the population over 25 (over 750,000 adults) holds a high school diploma or less.
•	46 percent of community college students are over the age of 25; 32 percent are between the ages of 20-24; and 22 percent are age 19 or less. This youngest group appears to be growing.
•	Approximately 38 percent of students in the region are “first generation” college students.
•	Across the ten colleges, 5 to 38 percent of students took one or more credit or noncredit ESL courses.

Approach to address needs. WestEd noted that the “Guided Pathways” approach can help support student success and equitable outcomes — whether certificates, employment, or transfer — by providing structured course sequences, careful intake and planning processes, rich learning opportunities, and robust support services. At the core of this approach is fundamental reconfiguration of the college experience that focuses on student needs and provides “intrusive” or proactive direction that guides students to completion and success. Three regional colleges are currently working with the California Guided Pathways project to develop guided pathways. 

There are four pillars in the guided pathways approach: clarify the path; enter the path; stay on the path; ensure learning. WestEd recommended adding a fifth pillar – employment preparation and transitions – to create Guided Career Pathways.  Rather than working with a subset of students, Guided Pathways is a collegewide undertaking that provides a framework for integrating all of the California-based initiatives. Regional approaches, especially for business engagement processes, can enhance alignment of the Guided Pathways approach with Strong Workforce goals. 

Through their research WestEd identified several key system components as critical for student success in college, employment, further education, and long-term careers. These components are closely aligned with those supported by the Guided Pathways initiative, with additional emphasis on career-related experiences and employment services. The key system components include:

•	Pre-enrollment engagement: activities conducted prior to matriculation with prospective students to facilitate enrollment, and aid in their understanding of the educational options, pathways, and services available.  This component is the focus of Project 1, Pre-College Outreach for Career Education.

•	Matriculation and comprehensive assessment: the process of enrolling in a community college and completing the necessary assessments and plans to pursue a pathway. 

•	Career exploration: a process of learning about career options through workshops, classes, tours, career-related research projects, informational interviews, and job shadows, based on identified interests and goals.

•	Career planning: development of a career plan, which includes a student’s interests, skills, and values, the career options that the student is interested in pursuing, and the educational and work-related experiences that will lead to one or more long-term career goals. 

•	Education planning: development of an education plan, which includes the documentation of the courses needed for a student to complete a specific degree, certificate, or transfer program of study and fulfill their educational goals, both at the community college level and beyond.

•	Pathway participation and career preparation: engagement with the courses and experiences offered in a career pathway. 

•	Applied and work-based learning (WBL): strategies that deepen learning and support career awareness, career exploration, and career preparation through engagement with employers and real work opportunities. 

•	Student supports: the full range of services needed to successfully complete pathways including tutoring, testing for special education, peer study groups, assessment and accessibility supports for students with disabilities, and nonacademic supports for personal needs such as just-in-time housing services, transportation and parking, food and nutrition, child care, financial assistance, and other subsidies. 

•	Employment preparation and transition: activities that prepare students to transition into further education, formal training, and/or the workforce such as resume writing, interview skills, job search services, letters of recommendation, and feedback and coaching opportunities.

Project 1 addresses pre-enrollment engagement.  This project addresses the college-based components of the Guided Career Pathways.  

WestEd made several overarching recommendations about employment readiness and job placement, including:

1.	Recognize career exposure and preparation as a central purpose of the college experience for all students and add a “fifth pillar” to the Guided Pathways model to reflect this view.

2.	Develop a regional approach to career preparation and job placement that builds coherence across all ten colleges for both students and employers.

3.	Integrate career preparation into instruction and student support delivered throughout the students’ college experience, from first entry through transfer and employment, to ensure successful transitions and job placement.

4.	Align institutional and program-level student learning outcomes to reflect a focus on career preparation for all students.

5.	Make career-related services and tools readily accessible to all students.

6.	Expand the scope of the learning environment to include workplaces and communities, positioning work-based learning as integral to career preparation and student success.

7.	Ensure adequate staffing and strengthen processes, supported by technology, to engage all students in comprehensive career planning and career preparation activities, keep them engaged, and monitor their success through employment, as well as to engage employers for advisory services, work-based learning, and job opportunities.

8.	To support students in navigating their college experience from pre-enrollment to employment, provide students a comprehensive and articulated set of the services, resources, and tools —including tools for career planning, career exploration, internships, and job placement.

WestEd provided more specific recommendations for each of the five pillars of the Guided Career Pathways. A copy of their report is available upon request. 

To address these recommendations, in Round 3 the SDIC region will undertake the following activities as part of this Guided Career Pathways project:

1.	Improved Student Pathway Navigation
2.	Work-based Learning Coordination and 21st Century Skills Transfer
3.	Employer Engagement
4.	Job Placement Case Management
5.	Faculty Professional Development

"The long-term objective for this project is to increase student enrollments through a regional marketing program to promote SDICCCA Career Education (CE) programs, with local implementation tools and options, utilizing a contracted marketing firm. ","CTE's share of statewide community college enrollment (FTES) declined from 31.3% in 2000/2001 to 28.2% in 2013/2014.  While non-CTE FTES increased 16.2% during this time period, CE FTES remained about the same.  Overall, in years when total FTES increases, the percentage increase for CE tends to be lower than for non-CTE.  In years when total FTES decreased, the percentage decrease in CE tends to be greater than for non-CTE.   This pattern has been observed in the San Diego/Imperial region as well as statewide. 

CTE enrollments have been in decline throughout the region over the past decade.  However, the gap between job openings and the availability of qualified applicants is expected to increase to over one million jobs statewide by 2025.  The number of students enrolling in CE programs in the region and statewide is not expected to fill that gap.  Strong Workforce Program local funds will provide additional CE training opportunities, but students must learn that they are available and that they offer the ability to earn a living wage.

In addition, regional partners identified several cross-sector employer needs/priorities by utilizing the findings from multiple sector studies.  The top priority is for workers with strong soft skills – communication, professionalism, critical thinking, problem solving, etc.  These soft skills make the difference in securing and retaining employment; previous work experience also is key for many well-paying middle-skill occupations, and employers across sectors report the need for more experienced workforce. Regional employers have difficulties finding qualified employees and are interested in new ways to find and cultivate new talent.  They indicate that industry-based certifications are an indicator to employers of a job candidate’s technical proficiency.  While some businesses surveyed (particularly in advanced manufacturing) indicated a strong interest in partnering with the community colleges for internships and company tours, many were not aware of the training programs that the community colleges offer or how they could partner with the colleges to find a qualified work force.

The colleges in the San Diego/Imperial region seek to increase enrollments in their CE programs.  However, each college has conducted its own marketing of its career technical education programs to students (with publication in the class schedule often the only CE marketing effort).  There is no cohesive, coherent message to all students and potential students in the region.  The State Chancellor's office has retained the services of renowned public relations firm Ogilvie to do an environmental scan and set a path forward on to deploy up to $3 million of state funds.  This project aims to ensure that the San Diego/Imperial regional plan is coordinated with that plan.

In addition, the public workforce system engages employers by program, with different people from different organizations calling employers to hire their participants.  Each college does its own marketing of its career education programs to employers; there is no cohesive, coherent message to all employers in the region.  

This project is addressing the identified needs by hiring a marketing firm to maintain a regional marketing program focused on increasing both student and employer involvement in the community colleges, and then implementing that regional plan.

In 2017 SCICCCA hired the marketing firm Civilian to develop a three-year marketing plan for Regional Career Education.  In 2017 Civilian conducted a program analysis, competitive analysis and consumer segmentation. Civilian used this information to develop a three-year marketing plan for Career Education, including brand planning, integrated media, and an evaluation plan.
The regional goal of the three-year marketing plan is to fill middle-skills job gaps. Regional Consortium objectives include (1) increase career education course enrollment, with focus on in-demand sectors; (2) expand the career education market through awareness and consideration among working adults and special populations; and (3) place graduates into the workforce, increasing the graduate employment rate and salary outcomes.  Target audiences include high school students, working adults, parents of high school students, educators of high school students, current community college students, and employers/the business community.  

The three-year plan’s media strategy is to reach audiences at various stages of the enrollment process using a data-driven, segmented approach.  Civilian recommended tactics that serve the purpose of funneling users from being aware to considering, and then enrolling.  Brand tactics include awareness via out-of-home advertising, including billboards and bus wraps to reach the broadest audience; awareness via digital radio with high-frequency, targeted ads; and digital display, which is a mix of media channels that reaches each audience where they are most likely to be online.

Enrollment tactics include the use of high-impact social media, with promoted posts on Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Snapchat; direct response reaching those actively looking for information on continuing their education; and retargeting by analyzing the use of the website and online behaviors to identify drop-offs and then guide them to enrollment.  
Civilian recommended that SDIC develop regional collateral by developing a fact sheet, press kit, PowerPoint presentation, infographics, an information kit for high school guidance counselors, presentation materials for high school assemblies, and talking points and boilerplate that CE Stakeholders can use to provide a consistent message.  The recommended public relations action plan includes a marketing inventory and audit of existing print and digital material as well as current channels used; collaboration with the regional colleges’ Public Information Officers on program milestones and media relations opportunities; collaboration with the WDC in support and collateral needed for employer outreach; development of an editorial calendar to organize content; and identification of student and graduate stories to highlight each college.

The SDIC region will implement these recommendations through2021.  In addition, the project will support regional staff to help coordinate marketing committee meetings and collaborative activities.
",\n,\n,\n
"The long-term objective for this project is to increase student enrollment in SDICCCA Career Education (CE) programs by overhauling college websites to increase the number of students successfully enrolling. Steps include colleges make changes to website to improve student experience and drive enrollment and implement an evaluation plan to measure effectiveness.  ","In the 2016-17 Strong Workforce Marketing Project, the marketing contractor (Civilian Agency) evaluated the user experience for enrolling in community college on all 10 SDICCCA college websites.  Through this “secret shopper” experience, Civilian determined that the user experience was very poor.  They projected that many students “give up” in the registration process because they find it too difficult to locate the information they need and complete the registration process.  This finding is consistent with other reports from the field.  

CE enrollments have been in decline throughout the region over the past decade.  However, the gap between job openings and the availability of qualified applicants is expected to increase – with employers of over one million jobs statewide by 2025 unable to find qualified workers to fill their job openings.  The number of students enrolling in CE programs in the region and statewide is not expected to fill that gap.  Strong Workforce Program local funds will provide additional CE training opportunities, but students must be able to access programs, and the current college websites present a barrier to students learning about CE programs and successfully enrolling in them.

The colleges in the San Diego/Imperial region seek to increase enrollments in their CE programs.  However, disorganized and out-of-date websites are a barrier to students registering.  This project will improve student user experiences on websites in all 10 colleges and ensure there is a cohesive, coherent message to all students and potential students in the region.  The State Chancellor's office has retained the services of renowned public relations firm Ogilvie to do an environmental scan and set a path forward to deploy up to $3 million of state funds.  SDICCCA has already committed $3 million (2016-18 Strong Workforce Program funding) to regional CE marketing.  This project aims to ensure that these investments will pay off with an improved user experience for SDICCCA college registration.

"Provide critical information (e.g., labor market, demand and supply, student outcomes data), analysis, and training for evidence-based decision-making for the SDIC region by expanding the capacity of the San Diego Imperial Region Center of Excellence for Labor Market Research (COE).","The Centers of Excellence (COE) aspire to be the leading source of regional workforce information and insight for California Community Colleges. As a grant-funded technical assistance provider, the COE works with colleges, regions and the sector networks to: (a) Identify opportunities and trends in high growth, emerging, and economically critical industries and occupations; (b) Estimate the gap between labor market demand, available training, and existing or future workers; (c) Help regions respond to workforce needs by providing them quality information for decision-making.

The Centers of Excellence deliver regional workforce research and technical expertise to California Community Colleges for program decision making and resource development.  This research and technical expertise include: 

•	Gap Analysis Reports match current and projected employment needs to the regional training supply, identify workforce gaps or oversupply and offer recommendations for alignment.

•	Environmental Scans provide a comprehensive overview for assessing industry trends, occupational needs and training supply, and usually include primary data collection.

•	Key Findings review and highlight significant findings from employer surveys or environmental scans. Short and to-the-point, Key Finding documents are designed for quick reference.

•	Labor Market Assessments provide an overview of the local labor market or college service area for high level planning and strategic development.

•	Research Briefs are customized for COE clients and vary in length and content.

•	Consultation and Technical Expertise is available to assist in the interpretation and application of data and research findings. The COE also provides input to organizations about data applications and tools that give community colleges better access to labor market information.

COE funds only one position for the San Diego/Imperial region, making it difficult for colleges to access the information they need in a timely manner.  This project will provide additional funding to the San Diego Imperial Region COE to enable it to employ more staff and expand the services provided.  These expanded services will provide data/analysis support for the local colleges and the region.
