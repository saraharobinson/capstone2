"341","Desert","4069","3","2019","The Desert Regional Consortium has made a concerted effort to address gaps in service areas by continuing to increase course offerings in the allowable program areas, reducing student barriers to education, and enhancing and expanding student services. This has been accomplished through partnerships and leveraging of resources.  
Additionally, the consortium has initiated strategies to address workforce oriented professional development, career centers, job developers, contextualized learning, articulations, pilots for orientation, intake, assessments, counseling and career pathways. These strategies have included our partners in the region that also supply workforce training and services.  As a result, relationships are developing with potential partners so that MOUs have been formed to leverage resources with agencies such as, Trade Union Apprenticeships, DPSS, County WIB, VA, DA and Tribal Nations.  
The DRC commissioned Resource Development Associates to undertake the creation of a Strategic Plan to determine specific needs and where to allocate future funding, programs and classes in the Coachella Valley. Data from the RDA Plan identified that less than 20% of adults over the age of 25 who live in the Coachella Valley Unified School District (CVUSD) have attended college or obtained an AA degree or higher. About ¼ of adults over the age of 25 living in the DSUSD and PSUSD regions have some college, but no degree.
The RDA Plan validated that there is a large disparity in educational attainment among individuals who live in the (CVUSD) region compared to the rest of the region. DSUSD and PSUSD are closer to the County (20%) and State (18%) rates. The majority (79%) of residents in the CVUSD region speak Spanish. Whereas, many of residents of the DSUSD (62%) and PSUSD (60%) regions speak English.
These insights validate expenditures in the East valley and as more data emerges it will indicate where to concentrate additional funding.
AEBG allocations are managed by the Desert Regional Consortium and are used to maintain principals of inclusion, transparency, collaboration, and equality, while building capacity to develop and implement systemic approaches for adult learners to achieve their academic and career goals. The DRC is an incubator for not only exchanging ideas, working with external partnerships, leveraging resources between members to eliminate gaps, but as a collaborative, as members work with each other as true partners beyond DRC meetings.","All AEBG allocations are approved unanimously and managed by the Desert Regional Consortium. All members use Galaxy software to maintain funds and is audited annually. Allocations are used to maintain, develop and foster adult education programs which support a pathway to the workforce, military, and post-secondary education, as per the DRC Three-year plan. The programs include English as a Second Language, Citizenship, High School Diploma, General Educational Development (GED), short-term Career and Technical Education, Pre-Apprenticeship, and Jail Programs. The DRC uses AEBG labor force data, Coachella Valley workforce data, and DRC survey data provided by Resource Development Associates from its own commissioned strategic plan for adult education for establishing spending needs within consortium boundaries. To assist adults as they complete their diplomas, certificates and programs, DRC members have hired Pathway Counselors for seamless transitions to workforce entry, reentry or post-secondary education.","All AEBG funds from present and prior years are used to fund DRC adult education programs. If a member is unable to use all their funding, the DRC will meet to determine additional needs and to determine how to expend said funds to address any pending needs. MOUs are created between members after a unanimous vote for the expenditure of unused funds.","The Desert Regional Consortium will have calendared working and committee meetings, open to the public, for the creation of the new 3-Plan. The DRC will seek input from the public and DRC partners. Information will include data from its attendance systems, TOPSPro reports, labor market reports, and RDA results, which will be used to drive areas of need and instruction. 

The new three-year plan will have common data (TOPSPro) from all members to make standards based, data-driven, results oriented decisions. The DRC will also use its own commissioned strategic plan which validates and/or highlights areas for growth. "
"364","North Orange","4092","3","2019","Working together with all eight NOCRC Members and numerous Partners throughout the 2017-18 implementation year, NOCRC stayed true to its stated Regional Comprehensive Plan (RCP) vision of Rethinking and Redesigning Adult Education…Together.  
The ideas of innovation, integration, and seamless transition drove the AEBG implementation strategies in 2017 – 2018. By partnering with the Love & Logic Institute, the consortium added two new sets of curriculum, Love and Logic: Supporting Youth with Challenging Pasts ® (trauma-informed practices) and Love and Logic: Supporting Youth with Special Needs ®.  Once approved by the CCC State Chancellor’s Office, the curricula will be offered as noncredit apportionment courses thus releasing AEBG funds for other needs of the consortium. 
As NOCRC plans for the fourth implementation year, its members identified successful strategies to be continued or expanded, the strategies with great potential but requiring modification and new strategies to be piloted or fully implemented. For example, ESL Mentorship strategy at the Fullerton College will be replicated at the Cypress College. Additionally, DSS Workgroup is designing a peer mentorship program for students transitioning from K12 to community college. New Regional Workforce: Collaboration & Development strategy will create a framework to align WIOA, Strong Workforce, and NOCRC Regional plans. The previous Workforce Development and Career Pathways strategy will be integrated into the existing CTE: Program Development, Pathways, Outreach, & Student Support strategy to eliminate duplication of efforts and to provide holistic career services.    Based on the regional need for high school diploma or its equivalency, Basic Skills Workgroup approved a high school equivalency direct instruction strategy utilizing a cohort model combined with additional skill development outside the classroom. 
In the upcoming year, NOCRC will deploy a comprehensive outreach and marketing plan, to boost brand awareness and move the needle on enrollment and retention. The plan will commence with a consortium-wide retreat to evaluate current community needs and marketing efforts and then create long-term strategies that would ensure the broadest reach.  The findings from the marketing plan research, will inform the 3-year NOCRC planning.
In summary, NOCRC will continue to Rethink and Redesign Adult Education in the 2017-18 implementation year.

","NOCR followed the established practices when approving 18/19 AEP allocations. First, the Exec Committee reviewed strategies proposed by the workgroups comprised of all NOCRC member representatives for each AEP program area. The strategies are intended to ensure the implementation of the NOCRC 3-year RCP. A budget is developed for each proposed strategy with all expenses identified and delineated as personnel or operational costs. AEP yearly allocations consist of the approved budgets for each strategy.  Additionally, the Exec Committee reviews and approves Project Lead annual budget – consortium-wide expenses, such admin cost and lease. ","The carry-over funds will help support with the implementation of the new strategies,  NOCRC Exec Retreat and one-time event(s) for student, partners and the community.  The carry-over funds will help support the student learning experience by curriculum software update for a regional partner. ","NOCRC will engage all eight consortium members and many partners in planning for the next 3-year comprehensive adult education plan. To ensure that the plan addresses adult learner needs that are specific to our region, the consortium will hold an outreach retreat with the goal of increasing awareness of educational opportunities and services within the region and learning about the characteristics of our service recipients and their needs. 
In addition to the overarching State AEBG outcome measures, NOCRC took the initiative to develop local effectiveness measures. The comprehensive approach in collecting and analyzing effectiveness data by combining state-mandated and locally developed measures will allow NOCRC to perform an in-depth analysis of the regional needs and evaluation of the most fitting strategies to meet them.  NOCRC invested one-time data collection funds into the development of a customized data management tool to support local effectiveness measures. The expected completion date is December 2018. The tool will collect, store and report on data necessary to understand and evaluate the effectiveness of efforts undertaken by the Adult Education Block Grant (AEBG) consortium.  
Broad goals and specific strategies will be developed in accordance with the established NOCRC procedures.  Specifically, upon approval of the 3-year goals by the NOCRC Executive Committee, representative program area workgroups will drive the initial planning with the expectation that the planned strategies will address the regional needs, have measurable outcomes, and align with other major initiatives, such as WIOA, Strong Workforce, Student Success and Equity, and Guided Pathways. Subsequently, the 3-year goals and strategies will be vetted by the NOCRC community partners and, finally, approved by the NOCRC Executive Committee. 
Upon approval of the 3-year comprehensive plan, NOCRC will engage all its members in developing an AEBG program review cycle using state member effectiveness guidelines and other helpful tools.  To capitalize on the existing evaluator mechanisms to the best extent possible, AEBG program review cycle will be aligned with the program review systems of the members providing adult education services.

","The uncertainty of the future funding makes it difficult to get permission to hire additional staff thus school districts are unwilling to expand programs without a guarantee of future funding. Attracting qualified instructors to adult education at adult schools. Lack of facilities at adult schools. ESL students are fearful of giving personal information which leads to decreased enrollment and difficulties in transitioning to College. ","The South Bay Adult Education Consortium remains committed to providing adult education classes to serve the greater South Bay community. We have been fiscally responsible with our funds to not only meet our current needs but to be able to continue providing ESL and ASE classes in the event of an economic downturn. Thus, the carryover in our budget. We are currently developing a plan to grow not only our ESL and ASE classes, but to add CTE and ABE classes, which are AEBG Program Areas.  
","The SBAEC consortium has begun a strategic planning process designed to bring a cohesive focus to the consortium. The strategic planning process is using an outside consultant to  meet with representatives from all consortium members, community, and other organizations to look at consortium strengths and weaknesses, as well as internal and external factors that affect services provided to the community.  Together the team developed three overarching goals with objectives and timelines to measure and monitor progress. The consortium board will monitor progress of goals and the entire team will meet in six months to evaluate progress and guide ongoing planning.   This strategic planning process will help guide the development of our three year plan.

"390","South Bay (Southwestern)","4118","3","2019","Vision: The South Bay Adult Education Consortium/Southwestern is committed to an ongoing effort to strengthen and enhance adult learner access, persistence and success. Members offer well-aligned educational programs that provide the region's adults with equitable access to educational services that will prepare them for citizenship, for completion of a high school diploma or equivalent, to gain skills for high demand jobs, and to transition to postsecondary institutions and/or the workforce. Adult education includes programs designed specifically for adults with disabilities. 

Accomplishments of Prior Year:

-Members provided ongoing AEBG noncredit and adult education courses. 

-Marketing plan implementation included modifications to the consortium website, development of a Twitter and Instagram account, and continued delivery of a Facebook ad.

-SWC curriculum development resulted in over 20 new/revised courses and programs that will be offered to meet the needs of the community. Progress was made toward code alignment, needs assessment, the development of enhanced student services for noncredit students (assessment, orientation, education planning, and counseling), and toward the campus-wide effort to provide a noncredit ID card that allows noncredit students access to the following services: library, tutoring, Child Development Center childcare discounts, health services, Disabled Student Services, employment services, veteran services, student discounts in the community, and participation in student organizations.

SUHSD served over 10,400 adult students in an array of high-need areas: ESL, Citizenship, ABE, HSD/HSE, and CTE. SUHSD restructured the Professional Learning Community process to focus on professional development around creating formative assessments, promoting completions, and improving internal consistency of curriculum implementation. Two staff release days were devoted to accelerate transition to AEBG alignment division-wide.

Primary goals for the upcoming year:

To maintain/increase the number of students served consortium-wide, SWC may offer new noncredit AEBG courses at adult school facilities, libraries, etc., and SUHSD may offer new adult ed courses at SWC facilities. 

Student ed planning and goal setting will become an institutionalized process for all AEBG students.

Adults with disabilities will receive the appropriate service based on their individual need.

All planned allocations are consistent with the 3 year plan.

","The planned allocations for CUSD, SWC, and SUHSD for 18-19 are consistent with the annual adult education plan, which is based on our AEBG 3 year plan, in that all three members will continue to provide programs and services outlined in our 3 year plan, and are committed to realizing the strategies outlined in the 18-19 adult education plan.","We will focus remaining carryover funds at the consortium level for marketing and outreach activities including, but not limited to:
- Establishing a marketing and outreach plan with an emphasis on ESL students and Adults with Disabilities
- Setting up a consortium table at back to school nights at elementary, middle, high schools, and at adult student events such as Viva Vida
- Aligning catalog production schedules and/or co-print one consortium catalog
- Utilizing a job developer/outreach specialist to help students with career exploration, job placement, and internships

Remaining carryover funds from SWC and CUSD will be incorprated into member budgets and workplans for 18-19.

","A consortium-wide summit was held in Spring 2018 to foster further relationship building among members. A mix of faculty, teachers, counselors, administrators, and classified staff were in attendance. Recommendations were made that we will use to inform our next 3 year plan, and we have plans to make the summit an annual consortium event. We will brainstorm other stakeholders that should be in attendance of this annual event, including community partners.

Our current workgroup structure is curricular in nature and is organized by program area. We will discuss a possible restructure and broadening of workgroup participation in order to better align with the broader AEBG goals, and to better inform our marketing and outreach practices. 

We will also utilize the recommendations from the current AEBG field teams to inform our 3 year planning process. The overarching roadmap for strategic planning includes:
- Professional development around establishing a planning mindset
- Understanding where we are by mapping out our current capacity, resources, and environment 
- Immersion into identified areas for improvement using data resources and stakeholder input. This will include discussions around our consortium structure, governance, and shaping a definition for member effectiveness.
- Development of strategies and tactics to improve pathways and ultimately, student outcomes.

The upcoming strategic planning process will be different than the original process that occurred over 3 years ago in that we will be able to leverage the relationships that we have built over the past few years to better create concrete outcomes for our collective students. "
"374","San Bernardino","4102","3","2019","In keeping with the Collective Impact approach of having the region work together, the Inland Adult Education Consortium (IAEC) has kept the spirit of collaboration central in all decision making. The Regional Comprehensive Plan serves as a foundational plan for the Consortium toward the realization of the vision and goals keeping in alignment with the county’s vision of working together to create regional stability among adult education service providers. By partnering with community service providers including businesses, government and CBOs, the Consortium continues to work toward creating a comprehensive regional approach for students by providing tools and support for their progression along their educational career pathways.


The Consortium implementation of services during the 2017-18 program year was based on refinements to the Regional Comprehensive Plan, data from Member Districts, LMI data, and strategies designed to directly impact the unmet academic needs of adult learners living within the region. The Consortium leadership chose three priority areas for the 2017-18 program year, with the goal of addressing the largest gaps in program area offerings to adult students. The three priority areas were High School Diploma/High School Equivalency, Basic Skills and English as a Second Language. The Community College District continued successful programs that were previously piloted for non-credit basic skills math. In addition, counselor/transition specialists were hired to assist in transitioning students from both non-credit to credit coursework at the college and work with each Adult School to transition students to postsecondary pathways.


In the 2018-19 fiscal year, IAEC will embrace the opportunities to work regionally on the assessment and placement of students, use of student data in program design, address further gaps in services, and identify ways to support accelerated learning programs for students' academic pathways and/or career goals. IAEC will also expand the offerings of CTE courses across the region. The region will work together on continuing the implementation of a Consortium-wide professional development calendar and build additional relationships with more community partners to better leverage existing resources.
","IAEC Board Members engage in ongoing data, program, and budget analysis to ensure continuous improvement among all Consortium Members and that decisions align to both the AEP Objectives and the AEP Program Areas, and to ensure that all funded initiatives align to the approved Three-Year Plan.","IAEC Member Districts participate in regularly scheduled Steering Committee meetings to examine budgetary needs and make recommendations to the Executive Board. Program Area Hubs also meet to discuss the program aspects of implementing the Annual Plan. The Executive Board reviews recommendations and votes on the spending of unallocated funds in accordance with AEP Allowable Uses Guidelines. ","The IAEC Executive Board holds regular meetings to analyze and discuss student data, regional LMI shifts and emergent trends, and issues being faced by the staff at each Member's sites.

"351","Lake Tahoe","4079","3","2019","In 2018-19 we plan to continue expanding opportunities for adult learners in our region by broadening access to career and technical education programs for adults through the use of the facilities at LTUSD in collaboration with the other members of the consortium to include focus on skilled jobs in the basin such as auto/diesel mechanics, additional culinary offerings, and explore construction and small engine repair. We will continue to increase our ability to ""transport"" these offerings to Alpine County to reduce the travel burden of residents, including members of the Washoe tribal community. This expansion of CTE services will also support adults working toward a high school credential by offering more opportunity for relevant learning that not only has value toward HS completion but provides career ready job skills. At the post-secondary level, efforts will continue to broaden access for non-traditional students, including explicit outreach around the Tahoe Promise program (first time, full-time tuition free year) as well as expand offerings on the ETPL, increase pre-apprenticeship engagement (while establishing a registered culinary apprenticeship with the State), and expand offerings and support for ESL and basic skills students.","We continue to build budget (and fiscal management)  using a needs and outcomes based approach. All members continue to improve identifying program work and goals prior to allocation and budgeting.","We will continue to use carry forward funds for one-time (or pilot) expenses so that we do not risk creating a ""false"" operating budget. In addition, all members are relooking their own needs as we prepare for the next 3-year plan.","One of the key strategies for the upcoming 3-year planning process is to more deeply, and officially, engage our network partners. Industry continues to play a key role in our work and formalizing those relationships - e.g., closer connection to the Chamber in the form of an MOA, and the creation of pre-/registered apprenticeship proposals with key hospitality properties have made it clear that not only are these partners critical, but have demonstrated ongoing commitment to our work. Determining how we might expand/evolve governance to include a ""voting"" seat at the table is one of the areas that the network wants to focus on during the planning process. In addition, the four key areas listed below have also been identified as critical to the continued growth and efficacy of the network here in South lake and Alpine County:

1. Increase Understanding to Strengthen the Network - Achieve better knowledge of resources, increase internal engagement, and build relationships through increased communication.

2. Tangible Outcomes - Continue to build a clear, connected pathway for network partners and participants to improve their lives and our community.

3. Addressing Special Populations (Equity, Access, Universal Design) - Explore, acknowledge, and build upon the client's unique strengths and needs to enhance their quality of life.

The members include Baldwin Park Adult and Community Education, Bassett Adult School, Charter Oak Adult School, Tri-Community Adult School (Covina-Valley USD), East San Gabriel Valley Regional Occupational Program, Hacienda La Puente Adult Education, Mt. San Antonio College – School of Continuing Education, Pomona Adult School, and Rowland Adult and Community Education. Completing the third year of the initial 3-year planning cycle, the consortium is on a confident path for our primary vision of aligning services, leveraging resources, transitioning students to employment and post-secondary institutions, and accelerating progress of adult students. 
The key goals of the 3-year plan are:  Program Growth, College and Career Pathways, Course Affordability, Expanded Course Schedules, Online and Distance Learning, and Improved Student Services.  
Over the past three years, progress has been made towards these goals. For the first two years, the perception that adult education allocations were considered a “grant” and not ongoing funding affected some schools’ ability to staff operations and deliver services. We have made strides in the areas of data collection and reporting, post-secondary pathway transitions, and placement with state employment agencies and partners. 
2017-18 Progress: 
Major regional needs identified in the 2017-18 plan focused on addressing the regional gaps in the core educational areas of English as a Second Language, Adult Basic/Secondary Education, Career Technical Education, and Adults with Disabilities population. Work groups are established in these service areas along with Counseling Student Support Services, Adults Training for Child School Success, and Data Accountability. The goal of moving students along established pathways is also under planning and development in the respective work groups along with addressing student barriers.
Primary Goals for 2018-19: 
Consistent with the current 3-year plan, the Consortium will continue to focus on the goals and activities outlined in the 2017-18 plan, noting that some campuses have already reached program capacity with existing funds. Continued focus will be on:
Staff professional development related to instructional improvement, Student acceleration, transitions to post-secondary and employment, Student outcomes, Data collection, and Member Effectiveness.","The planned allocations are consistent with this annual plan as funds are focused on the continued delivery of adult education to the students in need of our region. The majority of students entering our programs based on verified levels of literacy, lack of secondary diploma or equivalency, lack of sustainable employment or income, or related factors are the target seven mandated service populations of the California Adult Education program. The 3-year plan identified Program Growth, College and Career Pathways, Course Affordability, Expanded Course Schedules, Online and Distance Learning, and Improved Student Services as plan goals. Those are all, and continue to be, in progress. ","In addition to holding an amount in reserve, members will be encouraged to use carry-over funds to support one -time use activities including, limited target instructional projects. upgrading or repair of facilities, equipment or technology. Many lack upgraded signage and it is suggested schools purchase digital and/or upgraded permanent school identification. Supporting staff participation in related professional development, hosting collaborative partner events, promotional marketing campaigns are also options. Members may also consider mini-grants to organizations providing leveraged unique partnerships.","Organizing and developing the new 3-year plan will be include focus on alignment to local workforce development plans for the region as well as other major related state initiatives. We are reviewing the goals from the last 3 year plan to gauge which are still relevant moving forward.

Professional Development: In addition to the extensive professional development currently provided, a new technology workshop will be offered along with new training for those who work with incarcerated students.  
Leveraging: Continue to work with partners including an increased presence at county workforce development agencies and county corrections.  Increase partnerships with local business to develop and offer training programs.   

","As done previously, the consortium plans to use rollover funds for one-time expenditures such as travel/conference, instructional supplies, and curriculum and program development.  They will also be used for an intense marketing campaign.","The consortium has begun its planning process. Members reviewed the original three year plan and discussed how to accomplish unmet objectives and how to further the gains already achieved .  Members brainstormed new areas of need.  In this next phase, member performance and evaluation will be reviewed; labor market and demographic data will be analyzed to identify areas of need as well.  The planning process will be different in that partnerships and relationships have provided a foundation for our collaboration.  Members are more familiar with  the work of one another, so the new plan will be able to dig deeper into services and solutions for students."
"389","South Orange","4117","3","2019","The South Orange County Regional Consortium (SOCRC) will continue to build on the strong momentum its members have achieved from its three year plan in 2018-2019. The members will continue to maximize the impact of their allocations in alignment with this plan and the three year plan.  Our vision to to continue our outreach and programs to local communities to engage Adult Education Students across the region.  Efforts are being focused on increasing the retention of AEP students and their successful completion of coursework in AESL, CTE and general education curriculum classes.  We are now offering students a variety of class modalities across the region including onsite, online and hybrid platforms.  Our data and accountability cohort study research indicates that the two strongest barriers to course completion for our AEP students are transportation and family obligations.  Offering courses in a hybrid format at our sites directly addresses these two barriers to student success.  We are also expanding our locations:  at Tustin Unified School District (TUSD), faculty are offering classes at a One Stop Center at the Orange County Family Resource Center in Irvine with another SOCRC Partner, the Irvine Unified School District. The majority of our sites have added more pronunciation and conversational classes in response to student surveys.  Our community college partners continue to expand our portfolio of classes for Adults with Disabilities (AWD).  We are also enhancing our Career Technical Education in the areas of Pharmacy Technician, Surgical Technologist and Dental X-Ray Assistant in partnership with California Career Advantage.  Our resource allocations reflect these efforts and are consistent with our three year plan.  The result is that our AEP students invest a short period of time in a class and are then job ready within six months.  Our Capistrano Adult Education site has worked with local doctors, hospitals and pharmacies to ensure that AEP students are placed quickly and effectively into these jobs.  The Surgical Technologist and Pharmacy programs articulate with courses that begin at the high school level.  We ask the full-time faculty at Irvine Valley and Saddleback Colleges to collaborate with the SOCRC so that we may dovetail with other program efforts such as Strong Workforce and Guided Pathways, supporting and not supplanting each other's resources.  We continually assess our ability to address the five program areas under the program.","The SOCRC has taken a strategic alignment approach to spending planned allocations that is consistent with both our annual and three year plans.  Specifically, based upon our Mission and Vision Statements, the SOCRC members have created overarching goals, objectives and action steps that are directly linked to our resource allocations. Monthly-report outs guarantee that we are all updated and aware of the spend downs by our individual members.  Requests for large capital outlay amounts are required to be presented to all SOCRC members for review and approval.  Any site that is having delays in spending allocated funds is coached by our Executive Committee members to remove roadblocks and delays.  Our objectives and action steps are further tied to individual key performance indicators for the SOCRC.  We have a bi-annual review of expenditures and open discussions pertaining to the return on investment of the funds.  Any expenditures that have been deemed as ineffective are reallocated under program guidelines.  We continually remind our SOCRC members of the allowable and unallowable spending parameters prescribed by the Adult Education Program.  If SOCRC members are replaced, we offer a variety of human and paper resources to ensure that they are aware of spending and reporting deadlines.   Internal training is also part of our orientation process for the SOCRC members.  Those institutions who have had longer tenure with the AEP will often mentor junior SOCRC members in terms of spending guidelines.  The SOCRC Compliance Officer is also available at all times to address allocation issues and questions.  She ensures that all expenditures are in alignment with SOCRC strategic, annual and three year plans.  We often consult AEP personnel to ensure that we are in alignment with our resource allocation and regularly attend the technical AEP webinars, reporting back to our consortium members. ","Every effort is being made to reduce the total amount of funds being carried over by SOCRC members.  Specific strategies have included: 1) Requesting monthly updates on percentages of funds expended by members;  2) Collective review and approval of State documents such as the CFAD and other key collaterals that show distribution of funds; 3) Heavy involvement of South Orange County Community College District Fiscal Services Administration and Staff for large transactions; 4) Ensuring that funds are released to sub-recipients in a timely manner to ensure that they are able to expend them on schedule.  We have streamlined our efforts to make communication and information regarding budget expenditures available to all members.  Our Compliance Officer constantly reminds the consortium members as to key deadlines for expending funds.  She keeps in informal record of funds being expended, as they are reported at the SOCRC meetings.  This also helps with aggregate fiscal reporting that is required.  Our fiscal representatives from both the unified school districts and the South Orange County Community College District are in constant contact regarding AEP expenditures.  We have healthy, collaborative professional relationships and are able to keep all sub-recipients current with their funds.  All efforts are made to mitigate the amount of carry-over funds from sub recipients.  If funds are carried over, we have aggressive timelines for spending them down and tying them to AEP Program Objectives as much as possible.  ","The SOCRC coordinates its planning efforts within the South Orange County regional paradigm.  Specifically, it sends a representative to the Regional Work Group each month to participate in structural economic discussions and activities for the region.  The representative then returns to the consortium to report out on activities within the region and ways to engage in larger regional planning. In 2018, the SOCRC co-authored the South Orange County Work Group Regional Plan by providing a matrix of its services, goals and objectives to the Regional Planning Director. Another way that the SOCRC includes regional planning is to coordinate its efforts with the Orange County Department of Education (OCDOE).  Currently, the OCDOE is an active member of the SOCRC and has been since its formation.  This representative is a revolving position and is active within our consortium, informing us as to new educational initiatives for adult education in the region.  Efforts are also being made to involve local community groups in our planning process such as the regional Chambers of Commerce and Strong Workforce groups from Community Colleges. Several sites also have included Workforce Innovation Opportunity Act (WIOA) funding to support but not supplant the Adult Education Block Program, such as the WIOA Program at Saddleback College.  The planning process is pervasive and ongoing; we discuss our planning efforts at each monthly consortium meeting.  Our Cohort Study results are used as data analytics to inform all members of AEP students’ needs and accomplishments.  This provides real time information so that the members can make important planning decisions regarding budget and programs.  Inevitably, challenges arise because of program review.  We will then have working sessions whereby the consortium members tackle the issues relating to the challenges, planning new and innovative solutions.  This cycle of data informing program implementation has worked very successfully for the past three years of the program."
"358","Gateway (Merced)","4086","3","2019","Based on our needs, the Gateway Adult Education Network’s (GAEN) three-year adult education plan includes building our Adult Basic Skills courses and programs, increasing opportunities for Adults with Disabilities, and collaborating with local partners to increase our CTE courses and programs. Lastly, there is a need to increase student numbers across all Consortium members.

The GAEN community partners for 2017-18 included Merced and Mariposa County Workforce Investment, Human Services Agency, California Department of Rehabilitation, Merced County Adult Literacy Program, Mental Health, local labor union representatives, Central Valley Opportunity Center, and Kings View Work Experience Center. In 2018-19, more information will be gathered from local employers and organizations as the consortium works toward Career Technical programs leading to industry-recognized certification.

The majority of the member districts in GAEN will offer ESL to enhance adults’ proficiency in English and allow them to advance in their careers as well as connect with their children in a school setting. The classes will all be delivered to elementary schools, high schools, community colleges, and partner organizations. Also, at some of the schools, there will be classes for adults who wish to prepare for their GED Exam, complete their high school diplomas, or earn an equivalency certificate. Merced Adult School operates a testing center for both the GED and the HiSET tests. Merced College provides preparation classes for the GED Exam and refers students elsewhere for the actual testing, such as the Merced Adult School.

Building services for Adults with Disabilities and pre-apprenticeship courses will be a high priority for 2018-19. Unfortunately, services to Adults with Disabilities in the Merced County area are fractured, and the task of partnering to provide student support has been explored, but it has been thwarted by the lack of cohesiveness in the field as a whole. 

To increase student program numbers, we will invest in marketing strategies, which include the use of large banners, a regional adult education catalog, radio interviews, flyer distribution throughout Merced and Mariposa counties’ elementary schools and community organizations, open house-style orientations, and word-of-mouth to attract students throughout the area region.
  
Realistically, for the next year, most of the districts in the consortium will continue to work on developing lasting programs. ","Each member is responsible for submitting accurate Proposal for Funding Forms for each academic year that aligns with the overall AEBG 3 year work plans submitted to the state. Any revisions to the scope of work or modifications to program offerings require a revision to each member’s Proposal for Funding Form. If these changes result in budgetary changes, these changes must also be approved via a Budget Modification Request. All such forms are submitted for approval at local GAEN Board Meetings. Further details as to the complete process are stipulated below.
 
Also, Merced College, as the Fiscal Agent for the Consortium, requests quarterly Financial Status Reports (FSRs) from its members. The FSRs are reviewed for completeness of appropriate support documentation and consistency with the submitted work plans. Once reviewed by the Accounting Technician, they are routed to the Fiscal Agent's Certifying Official for additional review. The FSRs are routed back to Fiscal for record keeping. The Fiscal Agent then reviews the reported expenditures against the approved member's budgets. The members complete a Budget Modification Request Form that is then routed for approval at the GAEN Board Meeting. The Fiscal Agent receives all approved Budget Modification Request Forms and updates members' budgets as applicable. Each Consortium Member provides expenditure reports by object code to the fiscal agent which is then validated and combined for the Consortia to be reported to the State. Consensus and approval for the programs to be served in our Consortium were agreed upon at the __April 18th, 2018__GAEN Board Meeting. All members' work plans included details as to the populations to be served, and the work plans were approved at such meeting. As a Consortium, we serve within all seven categories, based on the needs of the region. As it relates to the 5% for administrative costs, the Fiscal Agent has agreed not to charge more than 5% of the AB104 funds allocated to the Consortium for administrative responsibilities. The Fiscal Agent will track hours spent for administrative procedures and only exact charge expenses, not to exceed 5% of the award amount. 



","The Consortium’s approach to incorporating remaining carry-over funds from prior years into strategies planned for 2018-19 include:
Additional funds to provide for students registered in ESL and GED classes. These students will have additional individualized support.  Additional support is particularly crucial for ESL and GED classes that need a more hands-on approach.
Additional funds allocated for Odysseyware and Burlington English.
Additional supplies and materials for CTE courses and programs.
Salaries for meeting the needs of our Adults with Disabilities.
Additional professional development.
Additional marketing and customer services courses.
","GAEN Consortium has already started conversations to plan for the next 3-year plan due in May/June of 2019. As a Consortium, we agreed that there is a need for better collaboration with our community partners, which include Worknet, Human Services Agency, Merced County Adult Literacy, Department of Corrections & Rehabilitation, Central Valley Regional Center, and law enforcement agencies.

The actual planning process for the next 3-year plan will be modified by including more community partners into the conversations, including more robust presentations at GAEN Board Meetings, conducting community surveys, and reviewing information from our Needs Assessment Report.

"337","Coast","4065","3","2019","In 2018-19, the Consortium’s primary focus is to expand the strategies that have started, begin implementation of those that have yet to be launched and incorporate selected new programs and strategies to make progress towards the realization of the vision and goals of the Consortium. Specifically, the Consortium will:
- Implement a comprehensive marketing and outreach plan 
- Expand co-enrollment in basic skills and CTE courses for integrated education training
- Work on CTE pathways and curriculum alignment
- Enhance the technical infrastructure, processes and systems needed to support the orientation, assessment, academic and career advising, and tracking of students transitioning from the adult education schools to community colleges
- Continue offering and refining the adult education program supported courses and programs to support the needs of the Adult Education students and local community.
- Enhance the outreach and transition support program for adult education students from the Adult Education Schools to community colleges
- Continue the work related to curriculum, competency and assessment alignment
- Provide professional development to support the improvement of the grant programs and achievement of grant objectives
- Continued collaboration of regional partners to leverage existing structures
","Each consortium member who receives an allocation is continuing to evaluate programs and services and allocate resources accordingly.","Due to locally negotiated agreements with unions and meet-and-confer entities, the salaries and benefits for the Adult Education Program positions are significantly higher in 2018-19 than previously budgeted. Thus, part of the carryover funds will help fund the difference between original budget and actual costs.

Professional development activities will be expanded to have a larger number of teachers, faculty and staff participate and become engaged in the activities of the AEBG.

Part of the funds will be utilized to train newly hired staff such that they can perform more effectively in their new positions.","The Consortium Executive Committee is the primary body developing the next three-year plan with input from stakeholders from not only consortium members but also various partners with whom the Consortium has worked over the past five years. We will seek input from a larger group of faculty, teachers, and staff from the consortium members. The level of understanding across consortium members and partners has changed significantly as a result of our work together in terms of awareness, collaboration, and shared goals and strategies. Thus, we are looking at the next three-year plan to be much better informed and more realistic than the original three-year plan. The next plan will be informed to a larger extent by data and analysis of the information collected over the past three years. We are also considering engaging in a planning retreat to fully focus on in depth discussions and brainstorming. "
"334","Mid Alameda County (Chabot-Las Positas)","4062","3","2019","The Mid-Alameda County Consortium (MACC) envisions all adults in its region having a clear pathway toward attainment of personal and career goals through seamless delivery of instructional, training and support services. Its three-year and annual plans seek to build and leverage the necessary supports for student goal attainment. Contributing to that end are 2017-18 accomplishments such as:
1.	integrating community agencies providing key student supports into the Community Pro Suite data/referral system
2.	sponsoring a cross-regional conference for teachers, classified staff and administrators
3.	a cross-system understanding of ESL student readiness for college coursework and a plan for developing a related assessment
4.	the emergence of contextualized and IET curricula
5.	community college open houses and class visits promoting student transition, including El Centro, the one-stop resource center at Chabot College 
6.	reformed strategy teams, now called work teams, operating with more concrete goals
7.	a new website providing information to the public and functioning as a communication hub for MACC participants

While the 2018-19 annual plan calls primarily for the maintenance of current programming, it also addresses growth and expansion within the limitations of funding that is outpaced by rising operational costs and reductions in WIOA funding. 2018-19 allocations were proportionally nearly identical to those of 2017-18, with slight variations in COLA distribution supporting limited growth led by members receiving higher funding. 

In 2018–19, MACC will build on recent accomplishments and move toward greater integration of programs and services by:
1.	adding classes in ESL and Citizenship
2.	offering new CTE courses (including programs for students with disabilities). 
3.	increasing the integration of contextualized instruction and integrated education and training 
4.	strengthening the capacity and coordination of Transition Specialists
5.	nurturing the partnership with the Alameda County Workforce Development Board by prioritizing integration of the AJCCs into Community Pro Suite 
6.	shifting from from planning to implementation of Community Pro Suite
7.	showcasing services and cultivating community interaction via the recently-launched web site. 

Finally, the MACC looks forward to developing the new three-year plan as an opportunity for assessing process and product to date and for refocusing its collaboration for greater student goal attainment.","2018 - 19 allocations were made in accordance with plans presented by members, most of which build incrementally on 2017 - 18 plans. Generally speaking, members receiving minor increases will offer programs and services similar in nature and number to those provided last year, while members receiving more significant increases will expand services and programs. ","No member is anticipated to have significant carryover funds to put toward addressing strategies for 2018 - 19. Members will use any carryover funds for the provision of consortium-supported programs and services that their agencies are responsible for.","The development of the MACC's original and aspirational three-year plan was led by consultants from WestEd. The original plan attempted to address a very broad and deep scope of implementation plans and activities, assuming a vastly greater funding level than the consortium actually received. In the ensuing years there has been a narrowing of focus on a more limited scope of activities, many of which turned out to be more infrastructure-building in nature than anticipated, thus resulting in a more measured pace toward student-centered goals.  As funding, staffing and collaboration challenges became clearer, a revised set of priorities emerged such as finding the right make-up and approaches for the strategy teams (which have morphed into work teams), an increased focus on the role and work of transition specialists, and a dedication of time, resources and energy into the implementation of Community Pro Suite.

With the benefit of lessons learned from the experience of the last three years, the MACC is beginning to organize a two-session retreat for development of the new three-year plan. At minimum, the retreat will address visioning, a review of the MACC's history and progress to date, a data review, a SWOT analysis, and a review of exemplary practices - all to inform development of the new plan. The retreat will convene representatives from various stakeholder communities and will capture input from many sources to inform plan development. 

Key among factors for consideration in the development of the three-year plan will be the impacts of 1) potential growth in community college non-credit programs, primarily as regards CTE and basic skills, 2) the implementation of AB705, 3) member effectiveness and consortium oversight policies and guidelines, 4) change management practice that supports progress from coordination to collaboration and to the solidification of group identity, and 5) the impact of the economy and joblessness rates on CTE and Pathways activities.

"347","San Diego East (Grossmont-Cuyamaca)","4075","3","2019","We are focused on Education That Works/Transitions That Matter, further implementing and expanding an innovative, aligned system that supports the communities of East San Diego County.  Our members have been embracing change, and ERAE students have noticed the changes: They can choose from several learning pathways with multiple entry and exit points; experience more career and college contextualized education in the classroom; and have access to holistic, personalized transition and support services that often start even before they are registered for specific classes. Education That Works/Transitions That Matter means expanding effective and ‘just-in-time’ learning opportunities that meet the diverse and changing needs of our adult students in an agile manner; it means alignment of efforts for equitable career pathways that support all students in reaching their full potential. 
-We designed a model for non-academic and personal support services available to all students in all consortium programs. All students entering consortium programs connect with a transition specialist through a medium of their choice; all students can meet with a college admissions and career counselor once a week; and all students have the option to participate in monthly, targeted college & career field trips. 
-Through braided transition and student services, we supported 81 students in matriculating directly into credit-bearing, transferable college courses. Advocacy on behalf of our adult students led to eligible students being accepted into College Promise programs.
-GAE signed an articulation agreement with Grossmont College for “Medical Terminology.” The Health Occupation Center consistently delivers high-quality training with a completion and certification rate of > 87%.
-We aligned academic calendars across consortium members. This provides students with an additional opportunity to access supplemental classes. The alignment affords consortium members opportunities in joint professional development.
-Outreach efforts and successes include a social media presence with more than 300,000 Twitter connections and more than 450,000 instances of LinkedIn engagement. We will:
-Develop 2 career pathways in the Mt. Empire region;
-Streamline matriculation & development of pathways to increase the number of students who acquire certificates, or specific skills for in-demand jobs;
-Continue Adult Ed workgroups as part of college presidents’ leadership council;
-Strengthen curricula","We have worked tirelessly and collaboratively on allocating funding wisely and timely. Program development and expansion of transition services happened primarily at Grossmont Adult Education, and we were fortunate in not facing any major challenges.","Carry-over funds will be allocated to professional development/training (collecting and utilizing data to promote student success; curriculum design; accelerated learning), a consolidated marketing campaign, and to a business engagement coordinator position. Decisions have been made collaboratively and with approval by the governing board.","In March 2018, the consortium initiated the planning process for the next 3 years with an “ERAE2020 Kickoff Summit.” The summit brought together 87 partners and stakeholders who made recommendations toward future priorities and a new mission statement. A steering committee and 6 task forces were formed to explore and expand on the initial recommendations: 
-Develop clear training and education options and paths for all students, in alignment with regional needs for skilled workers;
- Strengthen curricula through the integration of best practices for personalized learning (acceleration, dual enrollment, student centeredness);
-Establish a sustainable learning & working/professional development environment for consortium members, teachers, and staff;
-Establish the position of Business Engagement Coordinator to ensure consistent collaboration with and support for employers across educational and training institutions. 
-Develop a concrete partnership with San Diego and Imperial Counties Regional Consortium.
-Develop data protocols and routines across educational institutions.
-Improve the students’ overall experience (ROI) through student-centered services, personalized training,  clear measurements of effectiveness.
Task forces’ initial reports set timelines for short-term results and mid-range outcomes and include strategies and action items that will be piloted in 2018. A steering committee and manager will be guiding the planning process in collaboration with the task forces. Task forces include consortium members and community partners and stakeholders and will operate in an as-needed, agile manner. While partnerships and community engagement were barely established during the original planning process, we can now design a strategic plan based on a network of regional partners and key players and stakeholders in the community. One such strategic partnership will bring together the SDWP and the region’s five Adult Ed Program consortia. We now plan as a community and make decisions based on environmental scans, labor market research, and data analysis provided by the San Diego and Imperial Counties Regional Consortium, and data aggregated in TopsPro. Our ERAE2020 planning benefits from the statewide discussion on how we will facilitate learning in the future; we are much more focused on contextualized education, alignment with workforce development initiatives, and adult education as one crucial strategy to help the members of our communities to succeed."

Increased collaborations with local partners
Professional development in: Google Training, Passport to Student Wellness - Wrap-Around Services, CALPRO Accelerated IET Training 

Tahoe Truckee Unified has accomplished the following:
Offering a Pathway to Citizenship course
Added summer classes
Built a new GED testing center
Offered our first Blockly Coding workshop
Developed several new partnerships to add capacity
Increased enrollment from 232 to 414 (up 78.4%).  We saw this increase due to the expansion of variety of program offerings, increasing from 38 offerings to 56. 

Consortium wide, we served over 16,000 students which is approximately 30% more students than the prior year.

On the mission/progress we’ve made in past year, primary goals include: 
Work with industry partners to expand career training opportunities
Identify counseling and support services that help eliminate barriers to completion 
Address the wait-lists for our urban/more populated areas and expand our reach to rural and smaller regions within the consortium using technology and leveraging resources. 
More specifically address students with disabilities throughout our programs. 

","The annual plan allocation remains flat from previous years and is consistent with the initial percentages determined when the consortium formed.  However, this includes consortium-wide funds that will be dedicated to addressing consortium level projects identified in this plan.","Consortium schools will submit one-time expense project proposals for a portion of the consortium wide carry-over funds that will help them specifically address one of the needs identified in the annual plan.  ","For the first three years of Sierra ASSETS, the consortium focused on establishing relationships, identifying existing programs and services in our region, along with the gaps, and  aligning curriculum between schools where relevant.  We also added a new partner school into the consortium and provided them funds to launch new or revive dormant adult education programs, expanding services into these communities.  To plan and prioritize efforts in the past 3-year cycle, we organized into work groups using AEBG defined areas (ESL, AWD, Basic Skills, CTE) which provided time to dive deeper into the issues and learn from subject matter experts and instructors.  During this time, we gained a better understanding of the gaps across the region and common barriers we face to successfully transition students to career and/or post-secondary education.  While much was accomplished in terms of establishing relationships across partner organizations and curriculum alignment work in areas such as ESL, we believe that the time has come to shift our model for the next 3-year planning cycle.  Moving forward, we plan to build upon the learning gained and partnerships established in the workgroups, but take a more consortium-wide, project approach.  This next year, we will form project teams with a cross-section of relevant members, many from the prior workgroups, to address specific gaps or concerns that have surfaced in the past year. The steering committee will use the year to monitor projects, analyze shared enrollment and completion data as well as meet with students, counselors, partner agencies, employers and other stakeholders to determine needs and prioritize goals that will form the new 3-year plan in 2019.  We will continue to provide training and services unique to each member school and their day-to-day operations, but we believe a project-based model will allow us to leverage limited resources to target the highest priorities of the year and make a greater impact consortium wide."

RHC will continue to offer and increase classes on the adult school campuses.  These classes are well received and an excellent way to introduce adult students to higher education creating seamless transitions.  Articulation agreements are a priority for 18-19.  RHC has committed to facilitating articulation agreements with the RHRAEC member agencies.  CTE courses are continuing to be added, reviewed and aligned for pathways to ensure adult student success.  Tri-Cities ROP has been approved to begin a CNA program.  EMRAS has begun its construction program and is investigating logistic and manufacturing programs which industry advisory partners are requesting for immediate employment.  WAS has added an Introduction to Construction Fundamentals class.  EMRAS and RHC are developing a referral protocol to eliminate EMRAS’s ESL Wait List of adult students.  RHRAEC members continue to hold advisory meetings, review labor markets and dialog with business industry partners for regional employment needs. 
The 4.1% COLA was instrumental in maintaining most programs and was much appreciated.  ","All activities of RHREAC fall within the 7 approved program areas.  The largest portion of funding is allocated to personnel.  This does not allow for anymore growth and development except when a reduction is made in another area.  However, the COLA did help.","There will be no carry-overs for RHRAEC.","In 2018-2019 RHRAEC as an agenda item in our public monthly meetings will be reviewing and analyzing performance outcome data.  As a continued supportive team, members will share best practices, resources and strategies for adult student success.  Members will review past best practices and support new innovative and creative implementation of program and services, no more doing business as usual.  
The past three-year plan was ever evolving, changes in funding and/or lack of funding made for difficult expansion of programs.  Having a fiscal agent was cumbersome for meeting financial needs of each member organization. Maintaining financial obligations and still operate in serving students was difficult.  
RHRAEC is committed to our California Adult Education guidelines and Seven (7) program areas.  Allocation funding will be used to serve adult students; thus providing the best industry supported programs and services.  RHRAEC members will continue to be prudent in budgeting and expenses, ever mindful of student success.  As a result of the past three year’s success, members will: 1) share resources; 2) support each other in seamless transitions; 3) closing gaps that have been identified; 4) hold consortium wide professional developments in alike departments; 5) provide one-day tour(s); 6) and continue to provide college counselor for our adult students – (an RHC counselor at each adult school/ROP).  
RHRAEC has learned what works and what does not work.  First and foremost, we are committed to adult student success. We are committed to holding each other accountable and at the same time respecting each-others diverse community needs.  We are a committed Consortium to all adult students we serve and to each agency.

LARAEC Regional Consortium Plan (RCP) points to these elements as key tools to assist learners in transitioning to post-secondary programs and the workforce. These components clearly align with the AEP legislative objectives and the three overarching strategies of LARAEC’s RCP:  1. Defining Bridges and Pathways, 2. Developing Student Supports and, 3. Delineating Common Accountability Systems.  
 
LARAEC’s key accomplishments for last year (2017-18): 1. Conduct 59 pilots, with final pilot outcomes report to be reviewed in fall of 2018, 2. Provided inter-district professional development, including Communities of Practice, Professional Learning Communities, and IET training, 3. Outlined 20 CTE career pathways, 4. Developed the Quick Reference Guide for Counseling, 5. Created a web-based community resource guide and 6. Aligned K-12 ESL course outlines.  
 
The Consortium hosted the second annual LARAEC conference. This conference had over 550 registered, offered 32 professional development workshops, 24 adult education vendors, and welcomed multiple stakeholders, partners and guests from other consortia.  
 
Next Steps for LARAEC Include: 1. Create CTE pathways that articulate adult schools and community college, 2. Create a transition plan to post-secondary to be implemented across USDs for on-boarding to community colleges or to employment, 3. Develop a LARAEC inter-district professional development plan with input from all member districts, 4. Incorporate technology-supported instruction across all districts, 5. Support at least one IET program in each district, 6. Collaborate with the Los Angeles Public Library (LAPL) to expand LAPL services to all LARAEC students, and 7. Increase targeted collaboration between WorkSource Centers and America’s Job Centers of California to provide co-location, transitions, and support that lead to adult education students’ employment .

These components clearly align with the AEP legislation objectives and the three overarching strategies in LARAEC’s RCP. The expenses each district has incurred fully support the strategies outlined in LARAEC’s RCP. As a result of the MUSD audit released on November 2, 2017, carryover and ongoing funding allocations in the amount of $8,180,843 to Montebello were redistributed to the remaining LARAEC member districts. The resulting new allocations for each district support the Regional Comprehensive Plan strategies as outlined in LARAEC’s 2017-18 yearly plan. 
","BUSD:  
For the 2018-19 academic year BAS will be incorporating the carry-over funds from prior years in a number of capacities which will be outlined. The first is that of providing professional development for ESL teachers to continue to infuse technology into their classroom instruction. Teachers will be provided the materials and the hands-on experience to improve the quality of ESL instruction which will ultimately give students opportunities to utilize technology and thereby improve their employment skills. Furthermore, the funds will be used for staff development, and instructional materials and supplies to support students in a new class, ESL Intro to ABE, which was formerly known as ESL Level 6. The funds will also be used for salaries, as well as to provide professional development for those teachers involved in the new IET programs (ESL Health Occupations and ESL Information Technology), and to provide the necessary instructional materials and supplies. The carry-over funds will also be utilized for certificated salaries and for instructional materials and supplies for the new CTE programs set to launch in the fall and spring semesters.  
 
CCUSD: 
Culver City Unified School District has a carry-over for the first time since the outset of the consortium. The carry-over is a result of redistribution funds from a member district.  Culver City will use the remaining carryover funds from 2017-18 for certificated salaries and benefits, professional development, supplies and materials, and support services.  All purposes listed are aligned to the LARAEC RCP and Annual plan.  In addition to sustaining existing ESL, ABE and ASE programs for students, we offered a short-term ESL program for the first time in over 6 years.  Funds will also be used to open several CTE programs on Saturdays for the fall and spring semesters. 
 
LACCD: 
For the 2018-19 academic year, Los Angeles City College District will be use the carry-over funds to address several initiatives across the community college district. The first will be to increase the staffing with strategic hires at each campus in AE to address student on-boarding, student transitions from adult schools to community college and from community college to workforce or postsecondary. The district has established a process to host cross-college professional development opportunities to align programs, courses (curriculum), and policy. Faculty members will receive stipends for their involvement and/or deliverables. 
 
LAUSD:  
Carry-over funds from 2017-18 will be used for certificated salaries, professional development and support services. The certificated salaries will be maintained to ensure that the programs are fully funded, so that classes will remain open for students to take advantage of the various course offerings to help them meet their educational goals. The professional development opportunities will provide teachers the many exciting and innovative strategies to enhance their students’ learning experiences. The CTE and IET projects are two of the many projects that LAUSD will be working on this year to ensure that students will easily transition to postsecondary education and to assist them on accelerating their educational pathways.  
 
MUSD: 
Montebello Unified School District will utilize funds to help guide adult education teachers by incorporating hands-on activities and project-based learning within the classroom environment. Our articulation with East Los Angeles College has offered us the opportunity to work with all adult learners which includes our adults with disabilities. The carry-over funds will be utilized for student materials for all of our CTE courses that have been newly implemented in specific classes (Pharmacy Technician & Certified Nursing Assistant Program). In addition, funds will assist our Adult Ed instructors to become certified and abreast of particular certifications needed to expand the programs.   
 
The LARAEC office plans to use the carry-over in the following items and services: 
Existing contracts that rolled over from FY 2017-18 
a) Inter-district professional development and b) Office supplies  
Additionally, the cost will be applied to new or increased expenditures such as 
a) The LARAEC website, b) Audit contracts, c) The LARAEC conference d) Temporary personnel costs (regular meeting minute taker), and e) Office supplies 
","In writing to the AB86 Grant, LARAEC ran a series of focused workshops with participants (faculty, staff, and administrators) from the four unified school districts of Burbank, Culver City, Los Angeles, and Montebello as well as the Los Angeles Community College District. The workshops were facilitated by a team that addressed the objectives outlined in the planning grant.  The workshop series was the first time that planning had been implemented on such a scale as to address the needs of adults in the entire LA Region. The organization of the workshop format allowed stakeholders to understand how the various program areas and objectives were addressed across districts.  This understanding allowed greater collaboration and development of a plan that truly addressed the gaps in services and needs of students. A similar development process for the next three-year plan will start in the fall of 2018. 
 
The structure of LARAEC consists of a point-person (PP) representative and an executive team member from each member district. The PP representatives meet weekly to facilitate the work that is to be completed across each district regarding the annual and regional plans. The PP representatives report to the LARAEC Executive Team (ET), which consists of each district’s voting member. Because of the success of the AB86 writing format, the PPs plan to make a recommendation that a similar process be implemented with writing   the new three-year plan. A facilitator will be recommended to move the planning process forward. 
 
Data from across the LARAEC member districts will be used to inform the participants of the focused workshops and continue the data-driven process.

institutional boundaries to provide adults in our region seamless and integrated educational and career pathways and
services with multiple opportunities for successful entry and exit. Our three year plan describes the creation of these
seamless and integrated pathways which have occurred or will occur in multiple ways.
In 2017-18, ML ACE held a successful ""Curriculum to Career Summit"" that included member agencies faculty, support agencies that offer services to our adult population, college CTE instructors and industry representatives from three high growth industry sectors in Mendocino and Lake Counties.  Outcomes from the summit led to the piloting of a 21st Century Soft Skills workshop, which was offered to adult & career education students in Mendocino & Lake Counties, in collaboration with our local WIOA supported agency. Another outcome from the summit was the revision of a healthcare pathway mapping guide to include student support services which was then widely distributed to all agencies in our counties.  
In 2017-18 ML ACE continued to fill gaps in services in the region by adding a new member and implementing new high school diploma programs in Round Valley and Willits and adding classes for HiSet prep and ESL in Ft. Bragg and Round Valley.  In the area of seamless transitions and accelerated learning, a certificate program was developed and implemented for Adults with Disabilities at Mendocino College.  For professional development, we participated in regional data and accountability workshops, webinars and presented at the AEBG annual summit.  
In 2018-19 ML ACE will work to expand classes at agencies by offering more high school equivalency test prep courses, basic computer skills (non-credit) courses, and home health aide and in-home care provider courses.  ML ACE will continue to work with local workforce agencies to implement a common referral system and will hold our 2nd Annual Curriculum to Career Summit to complete the rapid asset mapping of our identified industry sectors.    We will continue to work with industry partners to explore more offerings in healthcare and construction.  We will expand our transition services at adult school locations with the addition of a student success coordinator.  
","ML ACE created an internal mini-grant giving process for non-MOE funds. We call these ""project based funds"". Over the past
year, ML ACE Agencies have submitted proposals for on-going programs/projects. These projects we then reviewed and
approved (or revised or denied). The implementation of these process gives MLACE significant over site of the funds,
allows us to know what each other are doing and ensures internal accountability. However, this delayed the initial
spending of our project based funds. We are on track to spend our funds before the ultimate deadline each year.
","We will be spending remaining 17-18 funds for project based funding and 18-19 funds for previously MOE funds. We will
completely spend 17-18 funds by June 30, 2019.","Our consortium holds regular monthly meetings and will designate time in those meetings to complete a review of our current three year plan.  Attendance and participation from all members at these meetings, will facilitate the use of performance and outcome data from TopsPro to capture the strategies that are working well for students and identify those that are not. The result of which will be the development of a new 3 year plan that addresses the areas lacking improved performance.  
This process will be enhanced from the previous planning process because there are more members and partner agencies involved.  "

The Regional Comprehensive Plan submitted in March 2015 serves as a foundational plan for the Consortium toward the realization of the vision and goals keeping in alignment with the region's vision of working together to create regional stability among adult education providers. FRAEC is committed to working with businesses, government agencies and educators, to ensure the development of a comprehensive, regional approach for adult learners by providing the necessary tools and support for their progression along their educational and career pathways.


FRAEC recognizes the need to shepherd adult learners through the continuum of services offered in and region to have a positive impact on educational attainment and overall economic development. Recognizing the missteps of prior years, the 2018-19 Annual Plan reflects a reset for the FRAEC and a full embrace of the AEP guidelines, opportunities to work regionally on the assessment and placement of students, use of student data in program design, the need to address gaps in services, and identification of ways to support accelerated learning programs for students' academic pathways and/or career goals. 


FRAEC is committed to providing formal direct, blended, and distance learning instruction via Plumas County Office of Education instructors across the AEP Program Areas. The FRAEC Members will work together on creating a Consortium-wide professional development calendar and build opportunities to meet the needs of rural areas through distance learning and collaborative instructional strategies.

"359","Coastal North","4087","3","2019","The Coastal North County Adult Education Consortium (CNCAEC) has been striving to increase and improve the adult education opportunities for residents of the north San Diego County region. In recent months the CNCAEC has undertaken a self-evaluation process to identify areas of improvement and create a more robust structure to achieve the intentions of the AB86 legislation. In that process, we recognized that we, as a Consortium, do not have a clearly defined vision and we will incorporate that into our next 3-year planning process to ensure we align our plan with the values of the CNCAEC members. The CNCAEC is proud of the work that has been accomplished in this past year. We have expanded our class offerings with adult education opportunities now available in all six of our region cities: Cardiff-by-the-Sea, Carlsbad, Carmel Valley, Encinitas, Oceanside, and Solana Beach. This expansion has resulted in an increase of locations by 61.5%, courses offered has increased by 29%, and the number of students served has increased by 35.9%! The career services specialist has continued working in classrooms with groups of students, coordinating job fairs and related events, and has provided job coaching to 87 individuals with several of those students now gainfully employed. This year we were also able to offer child care services for our students at three different locations with over 100 students accessing this benefit. In student focus groups we learned that for several of our students, this service made it possible for them to attend classes in the MiraCosta College Adult High School.  The primary goals for the coming year are to increase support services to all students, particularly at offsite locations and evening/weekend classes; establish a GED testing site to serve the region; improve opportunities for adult education students to transition to college or employment; and continue development of IET programs that contextualize basic skills or ESL into career education programs. The sole education provider in the CNCAEC, MiraCosta College, is implementing a new structure in support of AEBG that will be faculty-driven to ensure that strategies identified in the plan are achievable. The workgroups have already identified 15 areas from the original plan that still need attention, and those areas are aligned with the goals of the CNCAEC’s plan. ","MiraCosta College is the only education provider in the CNCAEC based on MOUs with the three member high school districts. Therefore 100% of the funds are allocated to MiraCosta College.

","The remaining carry-over funds will be incorporated directly into the 2018-19 budget as reported to the state. The internal processes for the CNCAEC fiscal agent support the assignment of different budget numbers that are used to ensure that first in funds are expended first. The fact that the CNCAEC has expended all 2015-16 allocations prior to the end of the 3-year allowable period demonstrates this fiduciary responsiveness.","The Coastal North County Adult Education Consortium (CNCAEC) is currently examining its structure and practices to identify areas of improvement. As part of that process we have realized that a more robust structure needs to be created to effectively implement the work of AEBG as well as embark on development of the next 3-year plan. At this time, that structure has not been fully approved but will likely include the creation of a CNCAEC Steering Committee with representation from community partners with a vested interest in providing adult education to residents of the region (e.g., workforce investment board, regional centers, NGOs, employers) as well as faculty representatives from MiraCosta College. The primary difference here from our prior process is that this structure will continue into the future to ensure the work identified in the plan will be effectively accomplished. "
"370","Rancho Santiago","4098","3","2019","The Rancho Santiago Adult Education Consortium’s (RSAEC) implementation plan for the 2018-2019 year is to continue with the goals set forth in the Regional Comprehensive Plan (RCP).  RSAEC’s 2017-2018 accomplishments include: 
The Department of Rehabilitation co-located at Santiago Canyon College Division of Continuing Education (SCC-DCE) and the Santa Ana Work Center co-located at Santa Ana College School of Continuing Education (SAC-SCE). This leveraging of resources allows RSAEC to better serve students in the areas of job placement resources and training.
In fall 2017, SCC-DCE opened its Adults with Disabilities program, which focuses on workforce preparation. In 2017-18, student headcount reached 110 students. SCC-DCE grew from 0 classes offered to 14 classes offered with a total enrollment of 378 students with 22 CDCP certificates awarded.
SAC-SCE opened the Remington Adult Education Center with full wrap-around services and programs in ESL, HSE, CTE and Pre-Apprenticeship. 
SCC-DCE created new CDCP Certificates to form pathways, which will lead to high-demand, high-wage employment.  These certificates include 3D Printing & Advanced Manufacturing, Digital Marketing, Home-Based Business and Certified Nurse Assistant. 
SAC-SCE offered its first pre-apprenticeship CDCP certificate in construction that included partners from industry, trade unions and workforce development.
Garden Grove Adult Education (GGAE) revised ESL exit exams to be based on competency and allow students to be evaluated mid-year so that they can seamlessly promote to the next level.
GGAE, SCC-CE and SAC-SCE completed a 2-year ESL curriculum alignment project. The new curriculum allows students to transfer seamlessly between programs and allows for consortia-wide curriculum collaboration and professional development.
GGAE and SAC-SCE successfully piloted a noncredit CTE course on GGAE’s campus. This leveraging of resources allows ESL students access to career technical training.
RSAEC’s vision for 2018-2019 is to continue the focus on offering more classes, increase contextualized learning opportunities, create new program and certificate options, and increase support services to adult learners within RSAEC to provide a smooth transition to college and career opportunities. To accomplish these goals, the consortium will explore new contextualized learning instructional strategies, which will lead to more opportunities for dual-enrollment. ","RSAEC's planned allocations align with the 3-year plan that was submitted in March, 2015.  The consortium remains dedicated to the four regional priorities set forth in the 3-year plan, which include building/leasing of new regional centers, opening additional sites in high need areas within one mile of targeted adult learners, hiring of full-time faculty and/or TOSA's, and the development of educational and career pathways. In regards to the first priority, building/leasing of new regional centers, RSAEC has opened two new regional centers over the past two years and the objectives in the annual plan are consistent with maintaining and growing these centers to provide educational and support services for adult learners in the region. Opening new sites in targeted areas within the consortium also remains a top priority. Nine full-time faculty and one full-time TOSA have been hired throughout the consortium. Their disciplines include the AEBG program areas of Career Technical Education, English as a Second Language/Citizenship, Adult Secondary and Basic Education and Adults with Disabilities. The objectives of the faculty and TOSA are consistent with the objectives of the 3-year plan: creation and implementation of new innovative curriculum, creation of college and career pathways which lead to seamless transitions, development of aligned courses and creation of articulation agreements, and development of accelerated courses. Lastly, the development of college and career pathways has remained a consistent objective from the beginning of the 3-Year Plan to each of the Annual Plans, including 2018-2019.  As the consortium is able to gather more data, the decisions on these pathways have become much more data-driven.  Industry roundtables, labor market indicators (LMI) and information from local business partners has helped guide the creation of new CTE programs in the areas of Allied Health and Hospitality and Tourism. The development of these programs will continue into the next year with an expansion of more Allied Health course options as well as the introduction of contextualized-based learning.  It is the intention that the incorporation of contextualized-based learning will accelerate student learning for students in basic skills and ESL programs.","At GGAE, the allocation will be used to fund maintenance of ongoing programs in the 7 AEBG areas including but not limited to, materials, staffing, facilities, maintenance, computers, ITS needs and expanding and enhancing technology.  In addition, there are plans to expand faculty participation in shared professional development activities and participation in state-wide conferences.  GGAE will also incorporate carry-over funds into data collection resources such as funding a dedicated researcher.   At RSCCD, the carry-over funds will be used to fund ongoing AEBG administrative, classified and faculty positions, as well as, AEBG facilities expenses, maintenance, ITS needs, expansion and enhancement of technology and support services for student and instructional programs.  In addition, consortium wide professional development and conferences are planned.  It is RSAEC's intention to fully expend 2017-2018 funds prior to using the 2018-2019 allocation.","RSAEC is always looking ahead to see how we can better serve the region's students.  Over the past 3 years, the members of RSAEC have continuously modified the existing 3-year plan to make sure that it was meeting the needs of the students while following the guidelines set forth by the state. In organizing and planning for the next 3-year plan, RSAEC will continue the work that was begun in 2014-2015. RSAEC is a relatively small consortium and over the past 3 years has seen a significant change in the executive board due to restructuring within member districts. For example, with the start of 2018-2019, 4 out of 6 of the voting members are new to AEBG.  During the planning stages, the workgroups had very limited access to clean data in the area of adult education.  With available funds from Data and Accountability as well as experience and knowledge acquired over the past 3 years, RSAEC is much more prepared to make data-informed decisions.  Strategy workgroups will focus specifically on areas that are RSAEC priorities, such as increasing contextualized learning opportunities, creating curriculum for career training programs that promotes student access to high-growth and high-wage job opportunities, and implementing data-driven best practices.  Consortium-wide professional development will also continue to be a top priority.  As new plans are implemented, instructors and staff will need to stay informed and educated so that the consortium goals can be delivered to the students."
"384","Sequoias","4112","3","2019","THIS IS A SUMMARY VERSION OF THE SAEC 2018.19 ANNUAL PLAN. THE FULL LENGTH VERSION CAN BE FOUND IN THE SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS SECTION, TITLED SAEC ANNUAL PLAN 2018.19 FULL VERSION

During the 2014/15 planning phase, Sequoias Adult Education Consortium (SAEC) members and partners convened to write a comprehensive strategic plan. Members and partners analyzed the then current levels of adult education and compared them with regional needs. From that analysis, SAEC developed its Regional Comprehensive Plan. The plan articulates strategies to fill gaps, transition students, accelerate students through transitions, provides professional development to staff, and leverages regional resources. Funding was then distributed to members on a needs basis to implement strategies. The strategies identified in that plan remain relevant to the region today.
Members made significant progress towards implementing the strategies identified in the SAEC Regional Comprehensive Plan.  The current 2018/19 SAEC Annual Plan reflects the progress made to implement those strategies and the work that will be accomplished during 2018/19. The 2018/19 Program Year Plan describe few new strategies. The majority of any new work described is the continued refinement of existing strategies.   
Furthermore, as noted in the SAEC Regional Comprehensive Plan, the AEBG to objectives  provide professional development and leverage regional resources are addressed in SAEC strategies focused on filling gaps, transitions, and acceleration. For example, to fill gaps SAEC planned, and implemented, a strategy to provide adult education courses.  The delivery of those courses by existing adult schools into communities that did not have adult education programs is built on members leveraging resources to host the classes at K-12 schools.  
SAEC members have engaged many new strategies that address and support regional adult education needs, in many areas and in creative ways. These strategies successfully address all of the AEBG objectives. SAEC members will continue to refine strategy implementation and adhere to the three year timeline. The limiting factor moving forward for the region's efforts in adult education will be dedicated funding. It is  estimated that the adult education providers are meeting less than 10% of the regional adult education needs. ","The SAEC 2018/19 annual plan strategies align with the SAEC 3-Year Regional Comprehensive plan. Both plans have been reviewed for alignment. Member allocations have been determined and approved by the SAEC Board and are reflected in the SAEC 2018/19 CFAD. All strategies listed in the SAEC 2018/19 Annual Plan align to the SAEC member allocation schedule. Approval of this plan by the SAEC Board signifies that alignment.","SAEC members follow a first in, first out expenditure model. All 2017/18 work is a continuation of existing strategies with new work being refinement in implementation. SAEC will also evaluate member expenditures and possibly reallocate unspent funds to other members to provide relief to member districts with unspent funds. This process is evidenced and explained in detail in the SAEC 2018/19 Consortium Memorandum of Understanding. The SAEC members and Board review allocation of resources periodically throughout the year. As Consortium Allocation Amendments are needed, the SAEC Board will review and approve any amendments.","SAEC began the 3-year planning process in the 2017/18 program year. Standing program area committees have met to evaluate regional needs, current efforts to meet those needs, and develop either current strategy refinement of develop new strategies to meet regional needs. SAEC has five standing governance committees. They are:

2. English as a Second Language Committee
3. Career Technical Education Committee
4. Adults with Disabilities Committee
5. SAEC Leadership Committee
Each committee has co-chairs and is affiliated with a SAEC Navigator. The navigators facilitate committee activities and collaboration. The SAEC Executive Director coordinates the efforts of all committees and facilitates communication between the SAEC Board and the committees.   Committee participation is open to anyone in the community with an interest in the work or focus of the committee. Committee meeting dates, times, locations, and agendas are provided to the public through several communication strategies to facilitate stakeholder participation. The SAEC Board meetings are public and participation is encouraged. SAEC has cultivated a culture of stakeholder participation and will continue to benefit from strong regional relationships and collaboration.

During the 2018/19 Program Year those committees will continue to meet. Strategies will be shared and discussed over the course of this planning year in multiple forums, including with the SAEC Board. Strategies and refinements from each committee will be incorporated into the new 3-year plan and SAEC anticipates final board approval of the plan in the spring of 2019.

The current 3-year planning process differs from our first 3-year planning process. The first 3-year planning process was facilitated by consultants.  Current planning will be coordinated and facilitated by SAEC staff and adult education staff. The planning and drafting process will be done in house.  "

"382","College of the Canyons","4110","3","2019","College of the Canyons (COC) and Golden Oak Adult School (GOAS) have partnered together to serve adult learners in the Santa Clarita Valley with a broad array of developmental and career education courses that expand access and opportunity for thousands of existing and potential students . The consortium’s vision, simply stated, is to provide a robust, comprehensive program supporting adult learners in the Santa Clarita Valley.  Our districts (the Santa Clarita Community College District and the William S. Hart Union High School District) have a long history of collaboration, and the AEBG consortium efforts have served to expand on the tradition of service to our community.

In the 2017-18 year, we successfully accomplished many of our goals either substantially or to completion.  We continued expansion of comprehensive orientation programs, identified transition courses, integrated career exploration components into GED preparation courses, implemented guidance and counseling services for students, pinpointed processes for ESL guidance and counseling, structured staffing roles based on student need as a consortium, and isolated avenues for braiding existing funding as well as explored sources of new funding. Additionally, we have identified accelerated instructional models in conjunction with dual enrollment to be implemented in Fall 2018.  We will continue with development of visual pathway maps for students and the community as well as joint outreach promoting adult education in the Santa Clarita Valley.  We will also continue our work with course alignment. 

","As a two-member consortium, we engage in a coordinated effort to reach consensus on activities and budgets and align the allocations accordingly. Allocations are proportionally equivalent to past years' allocations and reflect the financial needs of each member to support adult students in the Santa Clarita Valley. The method of direct funding allows us a more efficient means of access to funding for each member. Our regular fiscal and activity reports are discussed with the consortium management team and submitted as informational board reports. After discussion, budget and narrative reports are submitted by each member and certified.
The allocation has changed to include the COLA amount. Members have 100% agreement to adjust the allocation amounts to be increased proportionally from the last CFAD to include the additional COLA.
","Most of the carry over funding from prior years is related to funding for additional classroom sites and other capital outlay.  The leasing process is complex and involves unpredictable timing with permitting, tenant improvements, and other lengthy processes.  As such, though we had originally intended for our leases to be executed over a year ago, many of these setbacks put delays in the process.  During that time, we allocated and saved funds in order to cover those costs, but those funds have carried over to the present due to the delays.  We anticipate still using these funds to cover these capital outlay costs, but the burden has shifted to this coming year.  The identification of and establishment of additional classroom sites is consistent with our planning process, particularly with the previous annual plans.  We expect to be fully spent of our next year's funds by end of June 2019, which is the established goal.","In the 2018-19 program year, we plan to build upon many of the goals we established for the previous year while also looking to address gaps in service such as identifying additional funding streams , finding new sites for classes, and considering staffing changes to improve efficiency. Our allocations for the 2018-19 program increased from the previous year due to a COLA augmentation.  To that end, we believe the allocations are structured in such a way as to allow us to continue the work we started in earnest last year. Our consortium three-year plan addressed goals of program alignment, program relevance, coordination, ample student service, and professional development.  The 2018-19 Annual Plan continues to focus on these general categories by identifying additional resources needed to make continued improvement a reality.

","Adult education program funds are being expended in the 7 program areas and strategically focused on the current annual and 3 year plans. Funds are spent according to the Allowable Uses Guide in the appropriate object codes.","SAEC will use these funds to increase student access through expanded course offerings and summer school, build and bolster courses aligned with AEBG/WIOA programs and objectives, and develop more and better partnerships to promote student pathways to academic and workforce opportunities. SAEC will hire more staff, invest in staff professional development, and purchase materials and resources to enhance its acceleration and seamless transition strategies. In order to build community awareness of its programs and an understanding of student needs, SAEC will invest in a marketing campaign and communications plan to connect students to regional employment needs.","The first years of the consortium have been spent developing and solidifying collaborative relationships within the education community, Solano County, and the North Bay and Bay area regions.

In addition we continue to build our offering of ESL courses in the community by branching out to neighboring elementary schools, and CBO's as well as strengthen partnerships with our community partners that will allow us to offer basic skills courses, ESL and CTE opportunities to students who are considered nontraditional or disproportionately impacted.  This will also mean supporting faculty and aides who can assist in providing these services.  We will continue to support efforts on campus that are directed at meeting the seven program areas identified by AEBG. We will also in alignment to our submitted three year plan use funds to continue to provide professional development opportunities for faculty in meeting the needs of adult students as well as the Director of Adult Education.  There will be continued support to create marketing plans that will provide focus on the adult education program and courses.  Lastly, we will look at how we can begin to strengthen and create a comprehensive infrastructure that will support the colleges mission of a dedicated  noncredit adult education program in conjunction with the goals and objectives identified in our three  year plan.  LBCC adult education will continue to work with the Strong Workforce program to address high interest CTE programs for the community and students.  LBSA will provide a greater focus on creating course and programs aimed at meeting the lower literacy skills of potential students in the community.  They will also focus on keeping their CTE programs by creating short term, entry -level employment courses that also align to the college career pathways.","LBAEC will continue to focus on expending funds in the seven AEBG program areas ensuring  that they are consistent with the objectives and activities outlined in our adult education regional plan.  We will also address  funds in the order received with focus on incorporating and spending in a thoughtful way that aligns to our submitted three year plan.  Both members will continue to expend funds that can be use for the marketing of programs and courses throughout the Long Beach community and target potential adult education students. Additionally, LBAEC will continue to focus on creating new courses and programs that support the seven program areas which will also include professional development opportunities as  needed.  Additionally, LBCC will work toward creating a comprehensive adult education infrastructure by supporting staff in counseling, registration, and information technology to meet the community needs.  Funds will be used in the programs to provide support as needed to adult education students.","LBCC will focus on using a large number of our carry over funds in the development of a dedicated infrastructure for adult education.  We will ensure that money is used to support and further our adult education goals and objectives as well as meet the need of the community and potential students.  As a result we will continue tp provide support  to tutors, faculty. and staff in offering comprehensive service. We will also use money to support the offering of off site courses and programs with an increase in supporting student success by supplying materials and supplies as needed.  Additionally, we will continue to support counseling services between the adult school and the college for students to create seamless career and academic pathways.","To develop a comprehensive and thoughtful plan for the next three years, our consortium is planning on holding a series of workshops and planning meetings to gain a cross-section of  input for the plan.  Committees will be formed that consist of consortium members, faculty, community partners and students that will address the needs of our community, the needs of the educational institutions and goals and objectives that will allow us to create a comprehensive plan that builds on our first three year plan.  The planning process for this three year plan will differ greatly from the first plan as we are now more aware of what needs to be done to move the adult education goal forward.  We now have a Director of  Adult Education that has extensive background in adult education and understands how each of us must work together to create a comprehensive plan. Also in the creation of this three year plan we will have more comprehensive data regarding adult education programs, community needs, community partner needs and faculty understanding of the program provided through our labor market research that will serve as a tool in creation of the new plan."
"344","Foothill De Anza","4072","3","2019","Over the past three years, the NSCCSTC made consistent progress in meeting the goals set forth in their three-year Adult Education Plan and, more importantly, in meeting the needs of the region’s current and potential adult learners. In 2017-18, the NSCCSTC continued to make progress in key areas that include: 1) increasing the scope of transition and support services, 2) accelerating student progress through more contextualized and enriched curricula, 3) developing data systems and processes to track student outcomes; 4) increasing collaboration across the adult schools and community colleges; and 5) establishing new partnerships with community-based organizations (CBO)s and community groups, including new partnerships with organizations focused on serving immigrant and undocumented populations.  
For the 2018-19 year, the NSCCSTC developed an annual plan that continues to align consortium efforts with priorities and strategies set forth in the three-year plan, but also allows for the flexibility and innovation to continue to meet the evolving needs of the region’s adult learners. Over the coming year, the NSCCSTC will continue to focus on developing and strengthening the regional adult education system through the following objectives: 
•	Expand safety-net supports through new and current partnerships with local CBOs and community groups
•	Strengthen collaboration between adult school transition staff and their counterparts at community colleges
•	Increase the number of aligned and, where possible, articulated curricula and CTE programs
•	Identify opportunities to expand CTE programs to high-demand professions 
•	Create more work-based learning opportunities through new partnerships with local businesses 
•	Align ABE and ESL curricula to the evolving math and English placement standards
•	Increase professional development opportunities for AEP faculty and staff 
•	Provide more leadership and guidance for the NSCCSTC workgroups   
With the progress made over the past three years, the NSCCSTC continues to move forward with creating an accessible, coordinated, and comprehensive adult education system that works for all of the region’s adult learners. 
","In 2017-18, the NSCCSTC adult education and community college members continued to make progress towards achieving stated goals in their annual plan and three-year plan. Over the past three years, members used AEBG funding for a wide range of the consortium’s adult education needs, including faculty and staff salaries, curricula materials, academic and transitional supports, and professional development opportunities. Each year prior to the CFAD submission, the NSCCSTC reviews each member’s allocation amounts, budgets, and funded programs.  This process allows the Leadership Board to review each member’s progress, identify where progress has been made, and where there are still areas for growth. This process ensures that the NSCCSTC adult education programs remain aligned with the three-year plan, but can still adjust to an ever-changing landscape of adult and post-secondary education in the region.  
The NSCCSTC feels that maintaining a consistent allocation schedule for the coming year will support continuity of current AEBG-funded programs and services. The NSCCSTC has agreed to provide all five members with a 4.1% COLA increase. The NSCCSTC foresees a need for all members to have additional funds for potential shared costs such as hiring a consortium director, attending professional development events, or supporting other shared adult education efforts. The NSCCSTC engaged in annual planning activities in July 2018 to further align its adult education funding, activities, and objectives.  
","As a direct-funded consortium, all members are responsible for incorporating carry-over funds from their individual allocations into the planned strategies for 2018-19.  All members must report their carry-over amounts to the consortium members at monthly leadership meetings, CFAD planning, and for quarterly reporting in NOVA. Members are expected to manage individual carry-over amounts through their institutions’ fiscal management systems and processes.  ","The NSCCSTC has taken several steps to prepare for the three-year planning process next spring. First, the development of a student transition data tool will provide members with crucial data points to help understand adult learner outcomes and trends after transitioning from adult schools, which can inform priorities and strategies of the next three-year plan. Second, the NSCCSTC is planning to hire a consortium director who will be expected to lead the three-year planning process. Having a centralized and local individual to lead planning activities will greatly increase participation of all members to co-create the annual plan. Lastly, the NSCCSTC is waiting for more guidance from the state as to what the planning process will entail. This will allow the Leadership Board to decide what other courses of action are needed to ensure that this will be an effective, rigorous, and inclusive process.  "
"371","North Coast","4099","3","2019","During FY 18/19, the North Coast Adult Education Consortium (Redwoods) will be actively pursuing achievement of the goals and strategies as listed in this plan. Specifically, efforts will be made to refresh relationships, and perhaps expand consortium members, to integrate our efforts with those of others in our communities. Initiatives with regard to local tribes and networking with the new operator of the America's Job Center (locally known as the Job Market) will occur. In addition, a re-energized outreach effort will be made to reach adult learners within region. Collaboration with the Workforce Development Board and the business community will also be used to develop strategies which on a contemporary basis will meet the needs of the target population. Our overall goal and mission is to support career and academic success by providing preparation and skills needed for employment, college readiness, and on-going education. 


Some accomplishments from FY 17/18 from College of the Redwoods, Adult Education included: 
--Successful completion of the 4021 Review 
--Stabilization of student enrollment 
--Oversaw exponential growth of the ESL cohort in Del Norte County
--Reactivation of Adult Education ESL certificates
--Implementation of the HiSET examination sites
--Increased involvement and collaboration with local substance recovery programs for outreach purposes
--Strengthened partnership with the Humboldt County Correctional Facility (HCCF)
--Establishment of a faculty liaison
--Conversion of the management office in Old Town Eureka to also provide direct service to students
--Increased marketing 
--Obtaining robust CASAS data
--Providing cross training to other CR departments to better manage registration and admission paperwork

The North Coast Adult Education Consortium (Redwoods) looks forward in FY 18/19 to its work on the behalf of current and future adult education students in our region. 



","Allocations presented in this budget are appropriate to support the FY 18/19 adult education plan within the context the AEBG 3-year plan. With the recent transition of the former Director and Assistant Director of Adult Education at College of the Redwoods, a new leadership team has been put in place. 
Interviews are in progress to hire a new Student Development Advisor.  

This transition has provided an outstanding opportunity to refresh the relationships within the consortium and to move forward with the evolution of the AEBG grant and its five service areas. It also provides an opportunity to enhance communication between the Interim Director of Adult Education and CR Fiscal Department. The Interim Director will be consulting with the members of the consortium and CR administration to develop a spending plan which will spend down the grant carry-over funds. The objective will be to meet needs of the consortium members and adult learners. 

The 4021 Review was completed in Spring 2018. It authorized Adult Education at College of the Redwoods to proceed with writing new curricula and expanding adult education course offerings, based upon community needs. Funding through the AEBG grant will assist with these efforts. 


","Remaining carry-over funds from the prior year will be used to cover the Student Services Specialist IV out-of-class pay to manage the CASAS data. Additionally, funds will be spent to cover the costs of a temporary Student Services Specialist II and a HiSET Exam Administrator. Funds will also be used to pay for an in-house case management system which has been developed by Information Technology Department. Further funds will be used for outreach to students through a texting program, such as Mail Chimp. ","With personnel transitions occurring within both the Adult Education and consortium partners, this is an outstanding time to reestablish connections, redefine participation in the consortium, and develop more innovative ways to better expand/address the adult education learning needs within the region. It is the intention that our consortium will first review the parameters of the next 3-year plan. It will review past successes and challenges, with an eye toward strengthened services. The creation of the next 3-year plan dictates a need for regular and timely meeting with consortium members for their input and feedback. To support this work, our consortium has engaged a consultant to provided a framework and technical assistance to build on our strengths and provide additional training. "
"328","Allan Hancock","4056","3","2019","The AHC Consortium made considerable progress meeting the main goals of the 17/18 plan which had been initially identified in the AB86 3-yr plan. These are described as follows: (A) REGIONAL NEEDS: The consortium revised the work groups for ESL, vocational education, basic skills, High School diploma, and ESL Parent Academies to provide ongoing input on area needs. The HiSET testing was adopted and classes underwent revisions to include this new option. A part-time counselor for adults with disabilities is now in place assessing student needs and providing professional development workshops for instructors. Additionally, a CTE Advisory meeting will convene this fall to include input from area employers on gaps and regional needs connected to employability. (B) SEAMLESS TRANSITIONS – The consortium partners continued their work in developing articulation agreements and curriculum alignment in order to seamless transition students and incentivize acceleration of student progress. The consortium also continues developing CTE-related curriculum geared towards workforce preparation. The work groups have a foundational knowledge of best practices for instructional strategies, formative assessments, and expected outcomes. (C) DATA SHARING – With the adoption of CASAS to assess ESL students, the consortium has moved towards program alignment and seamless transitions. CASAS data discussion identifies gaps and patterns and develops effective practices for addressing these. The consortium addressed data collection and sharing, program alignment, seamless transition pathways, and maintaining the consortium’s mission. (D) PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT – The consortium continues to provide professional development opportunities to instructors. During 17/18, the consortium convened a regional AEBG consortium forum to share best practices and approaches, and an iBest workshop. The consortium plans to continue these for 2018/2019. (E) LEVERAGING RESOURCES – The consortium was successful in leveraging resources from 3SP, BSI and Title V funding at the community college campus to provide student services and support professional development.

","Planned allocations are used to meet activities listed in the annual plan and according to AEBG objectives. These funds have been used to: (a) develop meaningful CTE-related curriculum (courses and programs); (b) expand existing programs for increased student access; (c) define metrics to track student retention and success; (d) share and align data; (e) explore opportunities for potential course articulation; (f) explore student referral methods for student placement and/or education; (g) provide technology; (h) identify assessment tools; (i) provide meaningful professional development, and (j) encourage continued collaboration identifying other strategies for students’ seamless transition and acceleration.
","Carry-over funds are being used to meet AEBG objectives. The 2016-17 funds will be expended by December 2018. The 2017-2018 funds will continue to be expended in 2017-18 to support ongoing activities. The 2018-2019 funds will be used to support ongoing activities as well as fund new activities, especially activities related to the development of the next 3-year plan (i.e. advisory meetings, survey, data collection and analysis, narrative development, etc.)

","In preparation for the 3-yr plan, the consortium will hold a fall 2018 retreat to address the following aspects: (1) Effectiveness of the consortium structure and bylaws; (2) Revision of the consortium’s mission, vision, and values; (3) Potential rebranding of the consortium; (4) Self-Reflective analysis of the previous 3 years; and (5) Needs analysis.

The consortium hired a consortium project coordinator who will provide administrative support to the consortium board (implementing, tracking, assessing, and reporting consortium activities). This position increases the effectiveness of the consortium in areas such as developing and/or expanding partnerships with external agencies and organizations, and also seeking external funding opportunities (and/or leveraging external funding) in order to meet the objectives of AEBG funding for our region.

The next 3-year plan will continue to address ongoing gaps for our region. In addition, it will focus on effective tracking and assessment of student outcomes. To improve and expand effective tracking and reporting of learner outcomes (Bureau of Labor Statistics, census data, Chancellor’s Office data, CASAS data), other data options will be incorporated (LaunchBoard, O*Net, Salary Surfer, Centers of Excellence). There are also increased opportunities to leverage AEBG funding with Strong Workforce, BSI, Student Equity, and 3SP funding.

"391","State Center","4119","3","2019","The State Center Adult Education Consortium will continue to depend on concepts and principles set forth by our members to help guide the strengthening of adult education in our region. These principles form our vision of providing our adult learners with the skills needed for employment, continuing education, career advancement and personal growth. We will persist in enhancing adult education programs, expand course offerings, and nurture collaborative partnerships between educational institutions, workforce development organizations, employers, industry representatives, and community members, all while being focused on student success. 

This year’s planned allocations are consistent with our three-year plan, as we continue to grow, and close gaps in service by implementing intervention strategies discovered from best practices gathered from our region, and throughout the state while consulting data from our Regional Fact Sheet. The 2017-2018 year has shown numerous success stories including increased CTE/ESL/HSD/HSE offerings, hiring additional instructional staff, increased transition services to all students/members, developed and implemented programs. We continued to bridge the gaps from adult school to community college, purchased and updated needed technology equipment, planned and began implementation of new adult school facilities for Selma, Sanger, Kings Canyon and Sierra. We improved collaboration with local Workforce Boards by working closely on the ELL Navigator Pilot.

Our primary goals for this year will be to increase adult basic education availability, especially in rural areas, expand courses for immigrants, concentrating on ESL and Citizenship classes, improve adults with disabilities services, offer new, high demand, short-term CTE courses, as recommended by industry and current labor market information, and provide more resources for students to better understand career options, pathways, and opportunities. All members with the exception of the colleges will be using the ASAP Student Information System and AZTEC Software. All consortium members and workforce partners will utilize Community Pro Suites to highlight regional success.   

In conclusion, we are confident that through our strong leadership, our guiding vision, and our sharp focus on continually improving adult education and student success, State Center Adult Education Consortium will be able to meet and/or exceed all of our goals as set forth by our 2018-2019 Annual Plan.
","Members will spend their allocated AEP funds with the goal of closing any gaps in service and in meeting regional needs, as detailed in our 2018-2019 Annual Plan, and based on the 3-year AEP Plan.  AEP allocation funds are aligned with the Consortium’s goals of increasing education services and job training to meet the region’s needs in elementary/secondary basic skills, English as a Second Language, high school diploma programs, career and technical education, and programs for adults with disabilities.  Our members are committed to continued progress towards the realization of the vision and goals of the SCAEC 3-year Plan and will continue to implement identified strategies.  These identified strategies will fill the regional delivery gaps, support the seamless transition of students, increasing professional development opportunities for staff, and to accelerate transitions for learners across the State Center Adult Education Consortium region.

Members will be able to work with their district’s CBO or CFO to ensure that all AEP expenditures are in alignment with the SCAEC Annual Plan and 3-year Plan.  Budgets are reviewed on a regular basis.","Our consortium will incorporate remaining carry-over funds primarily through the following:
•	Expand our range of course offerings and increase the number of instructional hours by hiring additional faculty, and funding certificated salaries
•	Purchase or lease initial start-up materials and/or equipment required for any new course offerings
•	Purchase or lease needed equipment for existing programs
•	Expand facilities to accommodate the increase in enrollment
•	Utilize funds to contract with Valley ROP to offer more CTE courses in our region
•	Data and Accountability Specialist and Transitions Specialist salaries and benefits

Carry-over funds will be used to maintain current services and provide additional services as described in the regional needs and gaps, which are to increase CTE, basic skills, and ESL course offerings, while also upgrading career pathway and adults with disabilities services and programs.
","The State Center Adult Education Consortium will be organizing and planning for the next 3-year plan by creating workgroups that will be responsible for providing in-depth research on the region’s needs, compiling all data and information, analyzing data, making necessary recommendations to the board, and spearheading the data visualization needed to craft a well-composed narrative on the continual demand to bolster adult education in our region.  The goal is to provide SCAEC’s leadership team with the insight needed to accurately, as possible, predict future trends in economic, education, and workforce development, which in turn, will provide our adult learners with exemplary training in current and future skill development needed for employment, career advancement, and personal growth.  The SCAEC will help oversee the objectives of workgroups and provide deadlines for action items needed to progress.  

The above planning process will be different than the original process over 3 years ago because of the relationships that we have built with our college members, workforce partners, and community organizations. We now have a better understanding of our members and partners and understand how we are able to leverage resources to impact and serve our communities. Since our consortium is so large, we will plan regionally and sub-regionally to be able to dive deeper into the needs of those sub-regions that were established last year. Now that we have more guidance from the State, we will utilize data to assess if a new funding structure is necessary as we plan for the future. 

In conclusion, we believe that following this planning process, SCAEC will be able to create an exemplary AEP 3-year plan, that will provide its members with the guidance needed to navigate through all processes, challenges, and successes within adult education.

With state assurances that funding is ongoing, all members are committed to implementing our annual plan and spending the 2018-2019 funds in the same manner.","ACCEL has carried over funds from its data account and is in the process of purchasing a database management software system entitled ""Community Pro.""   The contract for this purchase is being approved and moving through our approval process.  This purchase will exhaust the carry over funds from the prior year.","ACCEL's first three year plan was developed when ACCEL was in its start-up phase of development, and was led by its two Co-Directors, Vice President of Instruction,  Gregory Anderson San Mateo Community College District and San Mateo Adult School Director, Larry Teshara, assisted by Consultant,  Paul Downs.   In 2016, ACCEL added an Executive Director to lead the Consortia.

Looking towards the future, recognizing the need to identify the educational and  workforce needs of our student population within our region, as well as  the challenges and opportunities presented within our member organizations, ACCEL’s management team held a one day retreat  in April 2018 to discuss and plan its strategic direction.  In this retreat, we reviewed our mission, vision, where we are now, and where we would like to be.   Each member shared information and challenges faced in an ever changing robust, technological economy.  In addition,  management team members each completed a SWOT analysis (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats).  The information obtained from this retreat was analyzed, synthesized, and compared with workforce development data regarding the occupational outlook forecast for in-demand jobs.  The information and data received will drive the development of ACCEL's upcoming three year plan.  

ACCEL's management team meets monthly; we will review our 2018 retreat information and findings, offer suggestions, corrections, and share with its Steering Committee its recommendations for our upcoming three year plan.

"339","Contra Costa","4067","3","2019","Over the past year, the Contra Costa County Adult Education Consortium (CCCAEC) made progress across most strategies from the CCCAEC Three-year Adult Education Plan. In particular, the CCCAEC workgroups developed and implemented shared processes, standards, and tools to articulate curricula, establish formal pathways, and align career and academic standards. The CCCAEC expanded the level of resources and supports for adult learners by purchasing various classroom resources and tool kits, expanding bridge programs, and refining the roles and responsibilities of transition specialists. Lastly, the CCCAEC decided to expand data capacity through investment in several data systems, including Community Pro and EMSI. The progress made by the CCCAEC in the 2017-18 fiscal year continues to move adult education in the region towards a seamless continuum of educational services and supports. 
Building on this progress, the CCCAEC will use Adult Education Program (AEP) funds in 2018-19 to continue efforts to align and redesign the existing adult education system to expand adult education programs and services, strengthen partnerships, and, most importantly, support and bolster the academic and career success of adult learners. Over the next year, the CCCAEC will focus on the following goals:
?	Align adult education math and English competencies with community college requirements and standards 
?	Expand bridge course offerings across all adult education locations
?	Expand the levels and types of services available for adults with disabilities
?	Align curriculum, student services, and transition activities to promote bi-directional student access 
?	Strengthen partnerships with community-based organizations and workforce development agencies 
?	Refine the CCCAEC infrastructure, including fiscal, voting, and management processes
?	Improve data integrity and develop more effective decision-making through the use of student, labor market, and fiscal data 
?	Develop a three-year strategic plan that is informed by data and responsive to the needs of adult learners throughout the region.","All CCCAEC members submit a budget each year to the budget and finance workgroup, which reviews budgets and budget requests to ensure members proposed usage of AEP funds aligns with the annual plan and the three-year plan. Once budget requests are approved by the budget and finance workgroup, a recommendation is made to the CCCAEC Steering Committee, which votes to approve or not approve the recommendation. This process is used for all fiscal planning and management, including annual budgets and work plans, making changes to budgets, and requests for additional funds. 

The budget and finance workgroup is currently leading a review of consortium effectiveness, including a review of consortium management models (consortium manager v. management firm – referred to Steering Committee), staffing structure – referred to Transitions, voting structure – referred to Governance, and funding models (direct funding vs. a fiscal agent). Consideration of funding models will be undertaken by the budget and fiscal workgroup as an activity in 2018-2019.
","All members are expected to use carryover funds for their original purpose as outlined in each member’s budget and workplan (see the prior answer for a description of budget and workplan approval). If a member cannot use carryover funds for the original purpose or if they want to change carryover funds for a different expenditure, they need to submit a budget request form to the budget and finance workgroup and provide a budget and justification for a change in funds. The budget and finance workgroup reviews all requests and makes recommendations to the CCCAEC Steering Committee for approval. ","The CCCAEC has already begun preparations for the three-year planning process to be completed by the spring of 2019. In 2017-18, the CCCAEC partnered with a firm to complete a regional needs assessment/gap analysis. The CCCAEC will use this information to inform the three-year plan and ensure that goals and strategies address the needs of current and potential adult learners in the region. The CCCAEC has also hired a consulting firm to facilitate a strategic planning process beginning in the fall of 2018. Conducting both the gap analysis and strategic planning in advance will provide the CCCAEC with data, structure, and time to develop a sustainable, measureable, feasible, and timely three-year adult education plan.

"356","Marin","4084","3","2019","Executive Summary:
The Marin Consortium will build on the progress made in 2017 – 18 by evaluation of current programming and making decisions on programs offered in specific locations within the county, additional student support services, and growing CTE offerings for adults. Continued, additional focus will include active transitioning activities and programs for adult newcomer students who desire to finish a high school equivalency program then transition to college while employed. In alignment with the consortium’s 3-year plan, additional classes in ESL and HSE will continue, as well as expanded Pearson Vue testing hours and locations. The Marin consortium continues to work effectively with CBO’s in providing services for other AEP adults.
Regional Planning Overview:
Programming for the current year includes:
•	Launching of e2c (Education 2 Careers) Program through the partnership of COM and Canal Alliance. This program, which will be piloted in Fall 2018, will provide wrap-around services to Marin’s highest needs residents in the Canal. 20 students will be selected by Canal Alliance partners to participate in this 7-week program that will result in a for-credit Construction skills certificate and a hiring fair through Marin Builders Exchange. Wrap around services include lunch/dinner (depending on time of class), financial planning, skills portfolio training and career readiness sessions. Courses are held 2 times per week – once a week in a space at Canal Alliance (in the Canal) and once a week on the Kentfield campus at College of Marin.
•	A part-time adult education counselor to meet with students throughout the Adult Education service area in Marin to develop educational and career plans.
•	A Case Manager to guide aging out newcomer students into continued ESL and GED Prep classes in Spanish. The Case Manager will refer students to CBO’s for additional non-academic support and services.
•	GED preparation courses taught in Spanish in San Rafael and Novato
•	Development of new noncredit hospitality, construction, business and landscaping non-credit CTE programs through College of Marin, campus supervisor training in Larkspur, instructional aid training in San Rafael, and continuing the introduction to in home care course in Larkspur.
•	Expanded Pearson Vue testing hours and locations
•	Continue partnership with the Marin Building Trades Council in offering pre-apprenticeship course in Marin
•	Continue parent education programs ","Marin consortium members present their annual plan and budget requests at a public consortium meeting. Discussion and decisions are made based on programming assessment, location of course/service, and available funds. In general, the Marin consortium has allocated funds in the following manner:

•	Shoreline Unified: funding for ESL classes in Tomales and Pt Reyes Station
•	Novato Unified: funding for ESL, GED in English and Spanish, high school diploma, authorization to become a Pearson Vue testing site to serve students who live in the north end of Marin County.
•	San Rafael City Schools: funding for ESL, GED prep in Spanish, and a newcomer case manager
•	Tam Adult School: funding for ESL, HSD, HSE, CTE, and Pearson Vue testing center
•	Marin County Office of Education: funding for parent education and CTE
•	College of Marin: ESL, non-credit CTE, shared adult education counselor, short-term, wrap around services for workforce skills development

Members are asked to present budget requests for the upcoming year by including the amount of available carryover in their request to the consortium for annual funding.
","Now that the start-up phase of many new Adult Education programming in Marin has integrated into regular programming, carry over funds should not be as prevalent as in the past. Carry-over funds are being used for increase counselor time, increase in Pearson Vue testing hours and increase in ESL & GED programming across the board.","Meeting Regional Needs
The Marin AEP Consortium routinely looks at regional heat maps and other data to assure members are meeting the needs of underserved adults in Marin. Our community partners are at the table regularly to ensure services are understood and aligned. We have strong partners in Career Point Marin, Canal Alliance and the Marin Builders Association, as well as those working in education at the county jail. We look for opportunities to build upon services and cooperate to reach those in need and to develop needed skills for our workforce.

"369","Northern Alameda County (Peralta)","4097","3","2019","In 2018-19 NAC's allocation will be consistent with the three-year adult education plan by continuing to serve the community through increased offerings of basic education, ESL, and career pathways.  Members are actively participating in all consortia activities, cultivating relationships across sectors, and collaborating with fellow member and partners to fulfill the mission of AEBG.  The leadership of the adult schools and colleges are dedicating resources to the development and expansion of curriculum and services to support our region's adult population.  Alignment of non-credit ESL, CTE/iBest pathways, transitions support, and co-location of courses are areas in which NAC members continue to focus.

NAC’s vision is to implement a co-op of shared resources, cultivate standards and develop an improved market that is committed to serving the adult learner population through successful development and delivery of programs, processes, and a system that transitions the learner from one entity to another without disruption to service. 

NAC accomplishments from 2017-2018 program year include the following:
•	Programming to address the needs in ESL levels. We saw increased enrollment, as well as improved completion based on CASAS data.
•	Offered more classes (not to the level before funding cuts, but increasing annually).
•	Hosted pathway event to focus on healthcare sector in the region. 
•	Partnered with Strong Workforce Program Director to align initiatives.
•	Developed partnership with Alameda County Parole to increase the visibility to re-entry population and provide wrap around support.
•	Hosted transition services at member sites .
•	Bridge course offerings increased.
•	Developed noncredit courses to increase ESL offerings.
•	Bay Area Alignment  partnership to integrate other programs serving young adults.
•	Completed phase 1 of our marketing campaign which was new website development.

In 18-19 our primary goals are to understand the needs of the adults in our region and develop programming that meets the needs based on a current needs assessment. We aim to ensure programming is offered for adults to obtain livable wage jobs, to address the ESL population needs, to increase the success of acclimation to society for the reentry population, and for the acceleration of diploma and degree attainment to the adults in need.","NAC's planned allocations are consistent with the 3 year plan because the AEBG funding is used for the following primary programs:
-ESL in the morning and evening for adult learners of all abilities. Instruction includes technology instruction, and contextualized language learning for students who are transitioning to post-secondary or career. 
-High School programming in the evening- both diploma and HS equivalency test preparation. A part time counselor meets with students to plan their academic and career goals. The counselor also refers students to wrap around students as needed. For both programs, we monitor student success and provide interventions to maximize student success.  
-Additionally, our family literacy programming is offered to the local elementary school for immigrant parents and is expanding career pathways through iBEST co-located college courses and job training opportunities. 
-Transition specialists continue to work with all members and partners to ensure student support is prevalent. In 18-19 our transition specialists will outreach to local industry partners to connect our College/Career Readiness and GED classes directly with organizations that are open to partnering.
- In order to inform our communities about the many opportunities available in the region, we will implement a full marketing campaign.  In 2017-18 we focused on developing a comprehensive, student friendly website.  Now that it is complete, in 18-19 we can take the next steps to advertise our programs.

","Our plan is to always spend first in, first out.  The largest amount of carry-over is allocated to leasing or purchasing a building for Oakland Adult School.  Additionally, we are developing processes for unfunded members to request funding and funded members to request additional funding from the carry-over allocation.  As we increase our marketing effort in this year, we will use a large portion of carry-over consortium funds to market collectively.   Lastly, a new project manager was hired in July 2018 to support the consortium and faculty led work.","To organize and plan for the second cycle three year plan NAC has developed a timeline based on the tentative May 2019 due date.  The outline includes review of the first cycle three year plan and status update of goals,  conduct a needs assessment to ensure our plans are based on data and the needs of the region, host a retreat to strategize with partners and members in our planning, and develop our plan collectively.  The difference between the first cycle's planning process and this cycle's process is the buy in from all members.  We will include partners that were brought in throughout the first cycle to discuss  second cycle planning.  It will be even more inclusive than the first cycle of planning because we are more knowledgeable than we were  during the first round and have developed more partnerships throughout this three year cycle."
"336","Citrus","4064","3","2019","The Citrus College Adult Education Consortium has a vision that all students achieve their career and educational goals. The CCAEC values efficiency, transparency, accountability, and institutional autonomy while member institutions provide quality programs for its adult students. CCAEC members help our region by offering a variety of vocational, career development, high school diploma and equivalency, basic academic skills, parent success, and English learner programs open to all adult students without discrimination. We provide our adults educational pathways into the workforce and/or higher education and all CCAEC courses facilitate our students’ incremental growth to pursue those pathways.

As the CCAEC moves into the fourth year of AEBG funding, the consortium believes it has made significant progress on addressing AEBG programs and objectives and it is poised to create a purposeful, effective 3-year plan.

By the end of 2017-18, CCAEC had maintained the levels and types of programs across the region that had been expanded in 2015-16 through regional collaboration and resource planning. These consortium maintained new offerings and programs in the face of higher costs from increases in salaries and contributions to retirement benefits.

Aligned learning objectives in CCAEC ESL, ASE, and ABE courses allowed for seamless transitions, and, critically, accelerated student outcomes. Language Proficiency Objectives for CCAEC ESL course descriptions were instrumental in creating a culture of progress and acceleration in all member ESL programs. Counseling efforts established pathway documents for CCAEC students so that they clearly understand how to achieve postsecondary and employment options. 

CCAEC members also leveraged the resources of a large number of partners to improve services for our students. Most notably, Monrovia USD utilized partnerships with WDBs to dramatically increase Title II funds to provide more CTE opportunities at no cost to CCAEC participants.

Increased WIOA funds allowed Claremont to better address HSD, ESL and ABE programs and better meet the  objectives of professional development and seamless transitions.

This 2018-19 Annual Plan demonstrates how CCAEC members plan to build upon the successes of the first three years of the program. The primary consortium goal for 2018-19 will focus on leveraging WDB funds to improve CTE programs for employers and potential employees.","The CCAEC board has made great strides to ensure that oversight of funds and effectiveness of plan implementation is a critical component of its responsibility. The consortium is approving a Fiscal Reporting Agreement outlining a general Memo of Understanding of the fiscal responsibilities for all members. All members must produce an Annual Plan that aligns with the consortium Annual Plan goals and details budget by program area. Budget revisions require a written proposal to be board approved. Expenditures must be certified and supported by back-up accounting documents.","CCAEC members do not have significant carry-over funds, but the funds are addressed in the current plan.","The organization and development process for the next CCAEC 3-year plan will differ in a number of ways from the original process pursued under AB86.  Much of the process used to create the CCAEC 3-year plan the began in 2015-16 entailed building trust and community among CCAEC members and traveling up a steep learning curve to meet state program and objective requirements. AEBG Allocation funding did not arrive until late January and this complicated meeting plan objectives. Over the previous three years, the state has brought online a variety of planning, budgeting, and reporting protocols and systems and the CCAEC has thoroughly met every state reporting requirement in a timely fashion. 

As state planning, budgeting and reporting systems have now solidified, so too have CCAEC systems to most efficiently meet the consortium mission. The process to complete the 3-year plan will mirror the last CCAEC CFAD process, which was very transparent eliciting feedback from numerous stakeholders. CCAEC members will engage in the process for the next 3-year plan from a position of knowledge and strength.

CCAEC members have engaged in numerous conversations with a variety of students, faculty, and educational and workforce agencies, and the 3-year planning process will continue those conversations. The 3-year plan will reflect the voices of a wide swath of regional voices. Consulting industry is the one arena where CCAEC members have had limited engagement, but want to expand efforts in a manner that is not overwhelming to local business.

Numerous initial meetings will allow stakeholders to voice priorities for the plan. As the plan takes shape,  stakeholders will review and comment on drafts. The final plan will approved by the CCAEC board in a public hearing."

7. Programs offering pre-apprenticeship training. The planned allocations will include partnership with the North Bay Trades Introduction Program.
","For the funded members: 
Carryover funds are on-track to be used by Napa Valley Adult Education as part of the normal operations, per planning herein. 
For Napa Valley College, carry-over funds have been incorporated into the plan to roll out new services covered within this plan. NVC has been behind with spending, but with its appointment of a permanent Director of Economic and Workforce Development, it is rolling out its implementation of its Corrective Action Plan to accelerate its programming accordingly.  
","For the next 3-year plan due in May/June 2019, Napa Valley Adult Education Consortium will gather information by: 
1. Review of Labor Market Data
2. Regional meetings with business community/other stakeholders to gather input 
3. A targeted meeting up-valley (targeting St. Helena and Calistoga in particular)
4. Board retreat to review input/revise draft
5. Work groups
6. Posting final version for public comment and board approval
7. Submitting to state and posting final approved version on NVAEC website

The pilot program, upon implementation, will be transferred to NUSD, to offer the same services to parents of students within the Needles school district service area, under the direction of the NUSD superintendent, Palo Verde College Dean of the Needles Center, and AEBG leadership.

Roadmap to Three-Year Plan:
Following the May consortium retreat, a series of conference calls, meetings, qualitative and quantitative research will lead to a second retreat that will develop a framework for the drafting of the plan.  Drafts will be vetted with stakeholders and ultimately approved by consortium members.
","For 2017-18, Palo Verde River Consortium, composed of Palo Verde Community College, Needles Unified School District, and Palo Verde Unified School District, allocations and priorities remained consistent with the strategies that were identified in the initial three-year plan.

These goals were originally identified in our original three-year plan, and have been continually reaffirmed by our members and stakeholders in following years. 

As in past years, the majority of our AEBG expenditures in 2018-19 will be on personnel costs relating to instruction, student support services, data and research, professional development and (to a lesser extent) grant administration. This allocation plan has been consistent throughout our work on AEBG. ","As of March 31, 2018, we had spent down the entirety of our 2016-17 AEBG funding, and have made significant progress in spending our 2017-18 funds. Following the principle of “first-in, first-out,” we plan to use these remaining funds for our 2018-19 activities as long as necessary before tapping into 2018-19 funds. Our workplans support this approach by emphasizing continuity of program development and expansion.","The development of the Consortium’s new three-year plan will involve extensive input from faculty, teachers, administrators, classified staff, students, and community partners, including:
•	Internal CCSF meetings between the AEBG team and the ESL, Transitional Studies, DSPS, Student Development, and CTE departments.  
•	SFUSD team planning meetings with representatives of Special Education, Newcomer programs, Counseling, Alternative Education, Dual Enrollment, College and Career Readiness, and data management.  
•	Regular CCSF-SFUSD planning meetings and collaborative work sessions to design and refine instructional programs and related projects.  
•	Multiple public convenings to gather input from current and potential adult education students.
•	Group and individual meetings with community partners to solicit input on adult education priorities and collaborative opportunities.
•	Meetings with employer partners to hear input on the basic skills levels required of the workforce and the potential to restructure noncredit course offerings.

In addition, we will align and coordinate our three-year plan with the WIOA Title I Regional Plan, the Strong Workforce Program Regional Plan, the K-12 Local Control and Accountability Plan, and CCSF’s plans for Institutional Effectiveness, Equity, SSSP, Basic Skills, and other categorical programs.

"381","Santa Barbara","4109","3","2019","Vision: To advance and design new programs tailored for adults in our region using data-driven decision-making, and an inclusive, collaborative and coordinated approach with stakeholders, program leaders, and public feedback. Goals include increasing the development of more bridges from noncredit to credit programs, diversifying educational programming which address current gaps and needs, and working in tandem with WIOA and Strong Workforce objectives.  

In addition to our ten existing  AEBG Programs, the Consortium recently increased its programming in its third-year cycle with the following:
1) Santa Barbara Library: Community Bridges Program. This program is designed to integrate all AEBG partners to effectively cross-refer clients; develop community resource awareness for adult learners; collate best practices that lead students to career pathways; offer workshops showcasing AEBG programs
2) The expansion of the Noncredit Student Support Services (SSS) Program to provide advising, career and academic counseling, improved orientation to noncredit programs and transitional support to jobs/careers or credit opportunities. 

Primary Goals for Upcoming 2018-2019 Year 
1)Continue to support our noncredit faculty in building bridges to credit for existing and new AEBG programs. 
2)Continue to fill gaps in Career Education in Industrial Technologies (or other areas supported by the study currently underway to be completed by 2018). 
3)Support new activity resulting from AB705 implementation (focused on mathematics, English, and ESL). 
4)Implement the Adults with Disability Career Planning and Training Program serving as preparation for further career technical and/or job placement assistance. 
5) Continue to partner with local Santa Barbara One-Stop operator and other agencies for career training initiatives.
6) Continue to cross-pollinate AEBG initiatives with WIOA and Strong Workforce initiatives. 
7) A commitment to the collection of accurate data and analytics for all AEBG programs and services
8) Continue to support our Student Support Services to help transition students from noncredit to credit or jobs/careers.
9) Continue to support our existing SBCC programs that are aligned with the AEBG initiatives.
10) Support job placement assistance efforts where feasible and allowable.","The overarching goals of our Consortium’s 3-year plan are to provide excellence in adult educational programming in order to accelerate transitions to transfer or career success. In addition, we set these specific annual goals:  1) Continue to support our noncredit faculty in building bridges to credit for existing and new AEBG programs. 2) Continue to fill gaps in Career Education in Industrial Technologies (or other areas supported by the study currently underway to be completed by 2018). 3) Support new activity resulting from AB705 implementation (focused on mathematics, English, and ESL). 4) Implement the Adults with Disability Career Planning and Training Program serving as preparation for further career technical and/or job placement assistance. 5) Continue to partner with local Santa Barbara One-Stop operator and other agencies for career training initiatives. 6) Continue to cross-pollinate AEBG initiatives with WIOA and Strong Workforce initiatives. 7) A commitment to the collection of accurate data and analytics for all AEBG programs and services. 8) Continue to support our Student Support Services to help transition students from noncredit to credit or jobs/careers. 9) Continue to support our existing SBCC programs that are aligned with the AEBG initiatives. 10) Support job placement assistance efforts where feasible and allowable.

To this end, the Consortium uses a request for proposal model (with a required timeline and activity chart), to encourage internal and external partners to submit programs in alignment not only with our Consortium goals, mission, and vision but also in alignment with the AEBG allowable programs and objectives. 
After proposals are received, the Consortium carefully vets these proposals to ensure alignment with the annual plan, the 3-year plan, and the statewide goals of AEBG, and only chooses to fund those that are in alignment, include only allowable expenditures, and that work to accomplish our objectives. 
The AEBG Coordinator is responsible for tracking the approved budget and all expenditures related to all program areas. Each program area has a program lead who reports expenditures directly to the AEBG Coordinator. The Coordinator verifies the Consortium approved expenditure, obtains approval by the AEBG Chair, and submits for payment by the fiscal agent.  The fiscal agent has created an AEBG account for each year of funding that reflects each Consortium approved expenditure and certifies those expenditures.
","Our Consortium’s approach to incorporating carry-over funds from prior years into planned activities for 2018-2019 is built into our successful process established from the beginning of Year 1. The Consortium has a Request for Proposal process, which includes documenting the timeline and activities for expenditures for each program. Once allocated through the process, funding recipients must expend in accordance with their submitted Timeline and Activity Chart and the deadlines set for that year’s funding. As a result, each program has an approved and tailored plan to expend funds timely. These plans, activities and expenditures are monitored by our AEBG Coordinator. If a program lead wishes to change activities or allocate differently than what was originally approved by the Consortium, they are required to petition for a change to the Consortium. If there are any unspent funds from a prior allocation for whatever reason (e.g., a program has completed its initiatives and spent less than expected, or the program has been terminated), the Consortium recaptures those funds and solicits a new public Request for Proposal with an adjusted deadline to ensure expenditures for those carry-over funds are expedited and timely. ","The changes in landscape in the last three years include new regional initiatives: Workforce Innovation Opportunity Act and Strong Workforce. We plan to work with these partners to integrate AEBG in the regional conversation. The AEBG Chair attends the South Central Coast Regional Consortium meetings and the Executive Director of the Workforce Development Board is an AEBG member. This helps us to stay regionally connected and collaborative. For the first time, we will be circulating our annual plan to these constituent organizations and request feedback and collaboration. Their regional goals will influence our new three-year plan. In addition, our strategy is to incorporate the three-year planning work into our public meeting process, which includes a mechanism for feedback from the public, SBCC students, faculty and administrators, and our other community-based partners. Finally, we will be exploring how our three-year plan might also support other major statewide community college initiatives, such as Guided Pathways."
"332","Santa Cruz","4060","3","2019","Our 18.19 Annual Plan is consistent and aligned with GOAL’s 3-Year Plan. The focus for our Consortium is on supporting adult education students to advance to employment and/or continued education, on increasing technology as appropriate to student needs and on the development of a bridge for transitioning students between the adult education system college and/or workforce. The alignment and integration of services that we seek is best achieved by focusing on pathways that serve the primary objectives of adult school students: Basic Skills, GED, ESL, CTE in serving students who wish to enter a career, advance in their career, or prepare for higher education within a CTE pathway. We will continue to strengthen the collaboration and partnership among Consortia members to one that is cohesive, collaborative, and cooperative and with a focus on student success. Support the on-boarding of our new funded partner Santa Cruz County Office of Ed; expand community awareness of adult education system opportunities for academic and career advancement through intensive and targeted marketing and outreach. Training and supporting new Transition Specialists and adult school and community college as well as expanded counseling services at the adult school to addressed increased need of counseling services for basic skills students transitioning to postsecondary. Develop a plan to expand adult education services in underserved areas of the Santa Cruz area such as San Lorenzo Valley in North County and Beach Flats; strengthen partnerships with CBOs and explore unique/new access points in existing service areas. We will align CTE, basic skills, and ESL pathways across our member institutions and expand ESL course offerings, including bridge classes, to meet community needs and help students transition to the postsecondary institution or workplace. Implement professional development activities centered on adult learning theory, CASAS assessment, technology application, and other best practices in adult learning. We will continue to articulate pathways in ESL, Basic Skills and CTE and facilitate improved communication & coordination among transition specialists/counselors/advisors of different consortium members.  Development of a comprehensive outreach & counseling plan for adult learners for transitional pathways to post-secondary institution/gainful employment. Explore the Immigrant Integration Framework and focus on populations with barriers to economic success. ","The consortium has developed a process to review and validate member expendiures and budgets accounting procedures to monitor grant allocations and expenditures by programs, objectives, and budget codes. The GOAL Director facilitates the review of quarterly expenditures, verifies members spending. Each partner member will maintain accurate records for audits or local reviews and is accountable for their own expenditures and questions regarding AEBG guidelines and regulations, and alignment to the Consortium's annual plan.","GOAL consortium plans to use carry-over funds for one-time expenditures such as focused and intensive consortia-wide marketing campaign, professional development, training, travel/conference, instructional supplies and curriculum and program alignment between its member institutions such as contextualized curriculum and exploring models such as IBEST, Human Centered Design, 3-year planning, etc. ","GOAL will work with with its member entities, partners, and stakeholders to analyze regional LMI data and identify long-term trends in high-growth sectors that will influence the planning at the Consortium level. Focus groups and working group, ad hoc committees, and board will be scheduled to collaboratively inform the development of the new Three-Year Plan. We plan to explore Human Centered Design with more focused intention as a framework to follow to inform the direction of our 3 Year Plan. "
"373","Riverside About Students","4101","3","2019","The ABOUT STUDENTS Consortium for Adult Education will continue to devote its efforts and resources to the expansion of the key program areas, including basic and secondary skills, English as a Second Language and immigrant services, and short-term Career Technical Education.  The consortium will continue to explore and provide additional opportunities to serve students needing workforce preparation, support for k-12 success, and adults with disabilities.  In alignment with the Three-year Plan, the local regional data demonstrates the need for additional services in areas lacking adult education services.  Members plan to increase course offerings in ABE and ASE academic classes, ESL, and short-term CTE to better serve the region and increase enrollment.  Additionally, members will focus on expanding our current processes for transitioning students to postsecondary education through educational advisors, campus tours and informational workshops.  The ABOUT Students Consortium will strategically expand its outreach connecting students to programs needed in the community.  Our goals includes increasing enrollment, expanding career pathways, increasing transition services to postsecondary education, and increasing effective outreach in our communities.  The ABOUT STUDENTS will emphasize its work to increase student completions and transitions to improve higher education opportunities, workforce attainment and reduce recidivism for incarcerated adults.  During the 2017/18 school year, the ABOUT STUDENTS Consortium has improved outcome data, provided regional professional development, and built support with community and educational partners, which has resulted in better service to students in our community.  Members are committed to share, continue, and expand successful practices that will strengthen our regional adult education programs.","The planned allocations will be spent in direct alignment with the goals identified and the gaps in service.  Support for programs and personnel to implement these programs will be the primary focus and utilization of the funds.  Ultimate goal of funding will be to prepare students for academic transition or workforce.  Increasing outreach and student support services, aligning transitions and pathways, and increasing access and capacity are drawn verbatim from the themes identified three year plan and encapsulate the spirit of the Adult Education Programs legislation.  The funding allocation will be spent exclusively on the described activities, which will advance the consortium’s goal of transitioning students to higher education and the workforce.  
Members are using their AEP allocation to increase capacity in basic skills, secondary education, English as a Second Language, and short-term Career Technical Education for all students.  Within the county jail, allocation will be used to build up the logistics program, and incorporate more online CTE offerings to assist student job seekers in a wider range of industry areas.
","Consortium members are strategically utilizing carry-over funds from prior years to complete activities planned in program development.  Additional staff and instructors are being hired into vacant positions, equipment and materials are being purchased, expenses related to program expansion and growth is also reducing carry-over funds.
RCCD has developed a thoughtful and sustainable approach to leveraging carryover funds to maximize the impact of California Adult Education dollars. The amount of the currently year’s allocation will support the base operations that will continue to be supported by these funds for the foreseeable future- costs to sustain the work of educational advisors, corresponding administrative staff, and faculty special projects for curriculum alignment. Carryover funds will be spend down on one-time costs that will create FTES generating transition mechanisms (noncredit courses), and costs that can be transitioned to other funding sources. This method allows RCCD to leverage carryover funds for maximum results without committing to covering ongoing costs that would not be sustainable once the carryover is exhausted.  
RCOE currently has all of adult education positions filled for the start of the 2018-19 school year.  The Logistics instructor, attendance and registration technician (ART) data and accountability oversight were all added/supplemented out of our AEBG carryover funding.  RCOE is on target to spend down its carryover.  
","The ABOUT STUDENTS Consortium will take a similar approach used when establishing the preliminary plan to develop the next 3-Year Plan.  Our members will work with regional data to develop strategies for further program expansion.  We will systematically analyze robust regional data and incorporate information from the Riverside Workforce Development Center and Employment Development Division, and reflect on enrollment and outcome data for the past 3 years.  We will use research employment opportunities in the region to inform our goals and strategies for the upcoming 3-Year Plan.  Our members will share successes and challenges experienced with implementing our plan and identify regional priorities.  During a Leadership Retreat, member representatives convened to discuss foundational elements of vision, mission, goals, strategies, and tactics that would serve as the basis for our plan development.  
The consortium will seek the input of community partners, educational faculty and leaders, employers, and students as we formulate our regional plan.  The current consortium member representatives have participated in the annual planning process and their experience will contribute to the development of an informed, well-considered 3-Year Plan.  Our expectations are that through the involvement and leadership of the current member representatives, valuable input will be gathered, local and regional priorities will be aligned, and strategies identified to address consortium sustainability, access and capacity, alignment of transitions and pathways, and outreach and support services.

"398","Siskiyous","4126","3","2019","Siskiyou County's vision for AEBG funding is to revitalize adult education in all areas of Siskiyou county and in
Tulelake. Consortia members have been developing and growing programs for adult learner success. The county is vast and
very rural, so it is important to design innovative solutions to services that serve our adult learners and overcome
their geographic and access challenges. The consortia's vision includes streamlining services while offering common
curriculum and diploma completion. This has been a consistent thread within our three-year and annual plans and continues
into the third year of funding with articulation between adult school programming and community college non-credit
development.
Active communication with all stakeholders and community partners is of utmost importance to our student base as we roll
out adult education programs throughout the county. Adult Education Pathways and its partners will need to provide ample
opportunity for learning, skill development, and overall collaborative efforts within local communities and county wide.
We plan to leverage our resources across the Siskiyou Community College districts in aligning curriculum and transition
adults into career and/or post secondary education.
The consortium believes that initial and ongoing development of its strategies and its staff is critically important to
the success of the new Adult Education model. All consortium partners, business community and county wide employer bases
will be encouraged to pursue more learners. This will allow for planning that ensures effective programs as needs change,
providing a wide range of opportunities for all adults. Adult Learners can be expected to obtain necessary skills
involved with employment and educational satisfaction. Allowing students to utilize the educational facilities county
wide and its flexible scheduling, taking into consideration personal capacity and learning modalities. The use of a
common diploma in conjunction with computer-based software that is aligned with that diploma, will help students complete
work at their own pace.","Our consortium sets aside 13% of funds on top of the Siskiyou County Office of Education budget that covers the Director's salary, benefits and travel, to fund consortium-wide programs and subscriptions. Our budgetary structure aligns well with our annual and 3-year plan that gives each voting member an internal budget to provide core adult educational services as well as a customized set of specialized services depending on their individual capabilities and the needs of their community. It also allows some flexibility to pursue systemic program improvements each year and pursue closer partnerships where funding can make possible new collaborative programs. 
","Moved the Director position out of the community college system to the county office of education to pay a competitive
wage and create some operational efficiencies. (Director started September 1, 2017) Carryover funds from 2017-18 were primarily from AV equipment budgeted for distance learning that was delayed. Budget was also set aside to hire a centrally available Transitional Specialist to help adult learners navigate to post-secondary and/or career pathways. The expense of a full-time employee became prohibitively expensive so holdover funding will be used to increase transition coordination capacity with STEP (our WIOA Title I). ","This 3-year planning process will be informed by student numbers, milestones, outcomes and internal consortium practices over the past 3 years. The first 3-year plan was about establishing the consortium, its policies, processes and procedures, to gather information and best practices from our adult schools, WIOA and community college and to align everything around a strategy that better serves students in our region. The challenges identified then still exist but our consortium has become highly functional on an organization level and with shared data, information, curriculum, communication and our business services are dialed in. The upcoming 3-year plan will be wholly focused on building off this foundation and pursuing student outcomes. We are focused on things like: transition coordination and guided pathways, common curriculum and the speed at which students move through programs, CTE and pre-apprenticeships that get students connected with skills and real world experiential learning, establishing integrated programming and referrals with regional government and non-profit partners, and systematizing student data and their outcomes to better identify continued gaps in real time.

For this 3-year plan, the Program Director for the consortium will work with a contractor who specializes in education planning and grant writing to work with each sub-region in obtaining information from faculty, staff, administrators, students, and community members as to how we can better serve each of the communities we serve by holding meetings, providing surveys, holding interviews and dialogue sessions, and looking at data related to labor market trends and student success.  The consortium will work with a data research team in order to obtain meaningful labor market data for members to use in determining what CTE pathways and programs we will look into building with industry partners in the community.  The Kern County Consortium serves an extremely large area, and many of our service areas vary a great deal in labor market trends.  We also serve areas in the Eastern Sierra (Ridgecrest and North Edwards) that have large populations who work on a military base.  In addition we serve an area with a large population of undocumented workers, incarcerated adults and ex-convicts, and contractors who are employed in the areas we serve but are paid by companies or organizations in other areas and states.  The data research team that we contract will ensure that the data the consortium is provided with for our planning is as consistent as possible by working with various data sources needed.
With the data obtained from the data research team as well as from the feedback the Program Director and Education Specialist collect from the community, our consortium will put together a 3-year plan designed to address how to build our service areas, provide outreach to the communities of our services, build programs that will best serve our community members and industry partners, and ultimately provide opportunities for success in careers and education for the members of our communities who are in the most need of help."
"362","Southwest Riverside","4090","3","2019","Southwest Riverside County Adult Education Regional Consortium has just completed a strong year of growth and progress.  As a unit, we were able to realize many of our original three year outcomes and implement some long range goals that were a focus for our team.

Our allocation for the upcoming year will allow us to continue to move forward with our 2018-2019 plan and put in places some of the beginning steps needed for our next three year plan.   2018-2019 was not just an update for 2017-2018, but instead a whole new focus to continue with the progress we had made from our first three year plan.  We will be building on prior year growth for the 2018-2019 academic year, and looking at using our allocations once again as carefully as possible as we continue to make progress and increase students served and outcomes accomplished.  We also are putting an intense focus on the collection and achievement of data and student outcomes.  Staff development, training and data review will be at the center of our plan for this transition year.

Our goal as a consortium is to build on what we have built so far to increase outcomes and look at common practices for all students. This will allow us to meet student needs while increasing outcomes across the region.  We will continue to offer region wide educational counseling services, additional career education classes and a greater number of more aligned classes to bridge our students into post-secondary.  This will be accomplished with more support from our partners and an intensified focus on using our partners to continue to serve our students concurrently.

Over the past year we increased our career education courses, including Automotive, CNA, HVAC Medical Assistant, Medical Back Office, and soft skill workshops based on the Regional Workforce report for Riverside County with areas of need.  This was an increase over the prior year with much more focus and concentration on building Career Education services region wide. We also doubled the number of opportunities offered for staff development with regional workshops, trainings and opportunities to attend conferences.  Lastly, we increased the number of students supported throughout our region and the number of completers and students transitioning from our program with outcomes accomplished.  We are looking to continue with this progress over the next school year. ","For the past three years, we have followed our initial plan and budget as we began implementing and expanding. We were fortunate to save some additional funds that were not allocated initially, to support new and innovative programs within our consortium.  This allowed us to plan as individual programs but also support each other as new ideas were proposed.

As we looked to creating a budget for the 2018-2019 academic year, we relied on this previous strategy and continued to budget some non-allocated funds.

As a consortium we also have many protocols in place that allow us to stay on budget with expenditures and when requesting additional funds or budget changes.  With these very transparent practices in place and with the fiscal lead still having oversight on all reporting, there is a culture of accountability and integrity to the plan.

All of our dialog and forward planning stays true to the original intent of our plan and the progress we have mapped out for the upcoming three year plan.    ","As a consortium we were impacted when the first year allocations were given so late in that first year.  Many of us were not able to actually implement our plans and spend accordingly.  This has followed some of us over the last couple years.  We wanted to ensure that expenditures were still aligned with our original plan.  As separate programs, many of us faced concerns from our districts about returning rollover funds. We needed to plan how to utilize rollover funds while still staying aligned to our three year plan and the impact when hiring staff.  All of these came into play as we continue to spend down our rollover allocations.  

One strategy to spend down rollover funds included our community college partner, and their hiring of counseling staff to support the whole consortium.  This expense was incurred by their program and within their allocation to help support post-secondary student transition.  

We also used rollover funding to support staff development and training for the 2017-2018 school year and will continue this practice into the 2018-2019 school year.  
","As we created our plan for the upcoming 2018-2019 academic year, we actually first began planning for the upcoming new three year plan.  By working in this order it made the 2018-2109 plan align to our vision for the three year plan.  

When we created our first three year plan close to five years ago, it was extremely difficult.  Although we worked collaboratively throughout the process, we were very hesitant to commit to major changes or progress.  There are some of us that have been with the consortium from the very beginning and understand what we first saw as our vision and mission. This now allows us to help keep the process moving forward using history and progress we have made collectively over the years. We also have been able to put a solid foundation in place.  By building this foundation, and being very realistic about what we have been able to accomplish, and what we want to accomplish, we no longer are having to spend so much time 
figuring out how to make things happen. Instead we can create a plan of what we will be able to implement successfully.  We now see that we need to increase the relationships with our partners and build out our whole consortium over the next three years.

Data and outcomes will also lead our new plan.  This is very different from years ago when our focus was on creating the foundation and building buy in throughout our individual programs.  With the ongoing funding being consistent and available, we are also seeing more support from our individual districts in allowing us to grow our programs and move forward implementing our plans.
Even the process of creating our plan has progressed.  This year we have already recently met as a group in order to plan what we individually want to accomplish and also having dialog about what each of us brings as a group to the team, what we are looking to accomplish and what we are committing to.  We are also more collaborative and committed to serving our region and growing in the areas we still have not completely realized.

In the 2018-19 FY, the AEP Stanislaus Mother Lode Regional Consortium proposes continued improvements and integration of adult education services in Stanislaus, Calaveras, and Tuolumne Counties by focusing on the following three priorities:.
• Expand programs currently in existence to include English as a Second Language, Career Technical Education, citizenship classes, Adult Secondary and Adult Basic Education.
• Reduce barriers and increase access and success for adult students by providing child care, career and college coaches/counselors, and increasing program offerings to include both day and evening classes at additional locations throughout the three-county area. Additionally, we will increase technology and classified support to these programs in the form of updated software programs, distance-learning sites, and clerical and para-professional support.
• Implement high wage/high demand courses and opportunities that will lead to specific industry certifications.
During the 2018-19 FY, the Stanislaus Mother Lode Consortium members are focused on the implementation of a collective 12-month work plan that is aligned with the three-year education plan. These efforts support building efforts in adult education for our three-county region. The Consortium will schedule consistent meeting dates that support approved governance and operating procedures. It is anticipated that this work will assist in developing a clear picture of regional needs and resources.
During the 2017-18 fiscal year consortium members collaborated and leveraged resources improving and/or enhancing services to adult education learners in the three-county region.
• Supportive Services: Child care, Career and academic counseling, inter-agency referrals including to incarcerated adults.
• Expansion of HSE, ABE, ASE, and ESL throughout the consortium region.
• Expansion of CTE programs, pathways, and industry certifications throughout the region (i.e. truck driving, forklift, industrial maintenance, welding, construction, phlebotomy, pharmacy technician, medical assisting, etc.).
• Expansion of Consortium public and private industry partnerships.
• Rebuild infrastructure and updated technology to meet current standards","The Stanislaus Mother Lode AE Consortium drafts, discusses and reviews the annual plan for the region taking into consideration the three-year planning documentation and the evolving changes of the region and member programmatic goals in servicing needs. Members further review and assure that annual work and associated allocations are linked to these planning documents and are consistent with AEP state guidelines.
The Yosemite Consortium (Stanislaus Mother Lode Regional Consortium) proposes to improve and expand adult education in Stanislaus, Calaveras, and Tuolumne Counties by focusing on the following three priorities as identified by consortium voting members.
1.	Expand programs currently in existence to include English as a Second Language, Career Technical Education, and Adult Secondary Education.

2.

"360","Monterey","4088","3","2019","MPAEC partners continue to work together to ensure that our planned allocations are consistent with our 3-year plan to create a thriving, expanded collaborative, adult education consortium for our region. Our 3-year plan identified priorities for our consortium to expand offerings in all program areas, improve transitions between schools, respond to the need to provide a variety of student support, provide quality instructional materials to help students succeed, and more information for students about course offerings, registration processes, child care, computer access, financial assistance, and other support available. 

Monterey Adult School (MAS) and Pacific Grove Adult Education (PGAE) funded ESL, HS Diploma/GED, and Adult with Disabilities programs. MAS, PGAE, and Carmel Adult School (CAS), continue to implement CTE programs to help students obtain new and stronger skills that translate to career opportunities in our region. Also working with local businesses providing ESL and skill development instruction to staff, PGAE continued partnerships with the Local Electrical Workers Union and the WIB providing on-site Apprenticeship Classes.

MPAEC 2018-2019 plan will focus on the following priorities to continue progress toward goals outlined in our 3-year plan: 

- Increased enrollment in the Adult Education programs through marketing/advertising.
- Supported opportunities for faculty and staff professional development at all sites. 
- PGAE will provide child care beginning next year, continue its Adults with Disabilities program providing classes to students with mild to severe disabilities. 
- CAS is building on ESL and HSD/GED 2018-2019- that provide integrated level ESL courses, which will increase enrollment (by approx. 100%) by working at 4 separate sites
- MAS absorbed MPUSD’s Certified Nursing Assistant Program and continued operation of 2 satellite ESL programs. The move to a new expanded campus incurred new infrastructure costs. MAS expanded Parent Ed which served over 130 adults.  MAS increased payment points by 27 %.
- MAS and MPC worked to develop pathways in HOSP and ECED. MAS has begun work on a new kitchen that will serve students in HOSP. 
- MPC is exploring  of  alignment of its ESL program with adult school partners and has established a pathways specialist position to facilitate this work. 
- MPC has begun to provide outreach and counseling services at specific adult school sites to assist students with education planning. 
","Since 2015, MPAEC has addressed the identified needs by providing pathways to high quality education and career opportunities for adult education students. MPAEC has facilitated meetings with students, teachers, and staff members to identify barriers to enrollment and success.  The MPAEC steering committee meets monthly to discuss these needs and determine how to best distribute our allocation to each of our members to best serve our student population. 
- PGAE has leveraged community resources and partnered with Gateway Center of Monterey Co. to provide a day program for Adults w/ Disabilities for students age 22 - adulthood.  Consortia resources enabled the site to design and implement a quality Adults W/ Disabilities day program, designed to provide students with curriculum and activities in daily living skills, personal development, fiscal responsibilities, civic engagement, college visits, and work experience.  A gardening class will enable the students to grow vegetables and plants to sell at the local farmer’s market.  Transportation will be provided for all students to have access to all sites.  Most PGAE consortia allocation for the 2018-2019 year will be dedicated to operation and capital outlay for this program. 
- Child Care services provided on adult education sites within our consortia have offered limited services and are at capacity and also identified for those students attending school, or returning to the workforce.
- CAS continues to provide EL services for local students, especially those in the hospitality field.  Our budget is largely spent on instructors and providing technical support to students.  We also provide child care when needed.
- MAS planned allocations are consistent with the annual adult education plan and the consortium 3-year plan. MAS focus remains on improving student outcomes within HSD and ESL as well as access to these programs, expanding our CTE pathways to include short-term certificate based classes, increased parent education classes, expanded computer classes, and a continued focus on adults w/ disabilities.
- MPC’s 2018-2019 planned allocations focus on dedicating staff and resources to strengthen pathways and transition between its partner Adult Schools and the College. MPC will use AEBG funding, together with Perkins and SWP funds, to establish a “Pathways Specialist” position to coordinate the development of pathways.  Funds will also be used to provide counseling and outreach srvcs at adult school sites","Pacific Grove Adult Education has encumbered all of its carry-over funds to meet the budget expenses  of their child care facility.  This program will open at the start of the 2017/2018 SY.
PGAE carry over amounts from previous year are encumbered to complete our Childcare Center.  Additional childcare services for students wanting to attend ESL, HSD,or Career Pathway classes on site will be offered free of charge.

Carmel Adult School did not have child care last year but did the year prior.  We will possibly need to transfer funds if the need arises this year. CAS carryover from the last two years will help cover expenses for the next two years.

Monterey Adult School’s carry over monies will remain focused on the program areas to which they were originally dedicated. These include expanded access and increased quality within ESL/HSD, CTE Pathways, Parent Education, Adults with Disabilities, and helping adults smoothly transition into post secondary education or a career. 

MPC’s carry over funds will be used to support areas for which they were originally planned. These include staff and faculty time focused on increasing communication, collaboration, and program alignment between Adult Schools and the College as well as Counseling and outreach time to help students at Adult School sites transition to College. Remaining funds will be used for staff and faculty professional development and to support marketing for the College’s ESL program. 
  
","MPAEC has begun to organize retreats to increase dialog across sites and begin to engage stakeholders from each site in identifying gaps/opportunities that exist and other data for use in upcoming planning sessions. The MPAEC steering committee plans to focus much of its early fall 2018 meeting time to ""planning to plan"" where we will review prior planning activities, explore other planning processes in place at each site, discuss models from other consortia, and seek input from others. In addition, we are in the process of recruiting a new consortium coordinator and intend to select an individual with experience in planning and implementing plans related to AEBG. The planning process will be different from the prior 3-year plan in that we will be able to draw from experience gained during the initial planning cycle, start the process early, and draw from models to guide our upcoming planning process. In addition, we are discussing the possibility of utilizing an external facilitator to help guide the planning process and related conversations. "

"367","San Diego North (Palomar)","4095","3","2019","The Education to Career Network of North San Diego County (ETCN) was able to meet, and in most cases exceed, our goals set in all key program areas. Major accomplishments in 2017-2018 include:
Symplicity- Student Career Services Manager: Rolled out an online program designed to assist students with career readiness, career exploration and job search. The Career Toolbox function provides students with online assistance developing resumes, cover letters and practicing interviewing techniques through online videos and specialized modules.  EMSI and ASAP – Initiating EMSI has informed our decision-making process as it relates to offering curriculum based on gaps and needs in the region. It is helping us identify growing industries and accomplished employers with whom we can partner. ASAP’s Service Hours module has helped counselors and advisors document and manage student appointments and caseloads more efficiently.  Legislative and Community Outreach Campaign: ETCN information packets were shared with local legislators leading up to visits during Legislator’s Day in Sacramento.  Established the first-ever county-wide “Adult Education Week” proclaimed by the San Diego County Board of Supervisors.  2nd Annual Path to Palomar Event: Based on the success of the first year’s event, Leadership members participated in the spring event designed to showcase Palomar College’s course offerings and introduce adult education students, many for the first time, to a college campus.  After the campus tours, students met with Palomar career counselors, transition coordinators and other support personnel. Digital Badging: Adopted the Riverside consortium’s badging program and ForAllSystems platform and began development of teacher training materials and roll-out program to students targeted to commence Fall 2018. Our 2018-19 plan goals include the following highlights: Host a Community Forum to inform and share achievements over the past 3 years and to gain input on ways to enhance student education/career success and determine industry workforce needs; Roll out of the digital badging program and development of 2nd phase for CTE courses and pathways; Continue alignment and integration of curriculum to accelerate student learning and meet regional workforce needs; Developing Adult Education Pre-Apprentice programs which either articulate to Palomar College or directly into a trade union program; ETCN’s motto “It’s Working” continues to ring true within the communities we serve.","To ensure fiscal accountability and continued transparency, ETCN employs an outside auditor to review our books annually. 

Funds were allocated and spent according to our goals for FY 2017-18.  These included increased emphasis on stakeholder/partner engagement to support student education and career success; implementation of common student data tools to gather, measure, and analyze student and/or program successes and outcomes and share best practices; roll-out of Symplicity and Canvas, new platforms to assist students with work-readiness, career exploration, and job search; and continued alignment and integration of curriculum to accelerate student learning and meet regional needs.

To accomplish the goals above, members interacted on a more frequent basis, with shared positions spending time addressing the needs of each individual member district. CASAS pre/post testing was used at all member districts as a common student data tool. Symplicity and Canvas were rolled out and students could begin using the tools for work-readiness, career exploration and job search. Additional progress was made in curriculum alignment as well. The Beginning Algebra class that was created collaboratively between adult school and college faculty was piloted at Vista Adult School.  Next steps are to analyze the results and expand to other adult schools. We will continue to develop bridge math and language arts classes this year to make sure students from the adult schools are ready to enter transferable college level math and English upon their transfer to Palomar College.

","A standing agenda item at every leadership council meeting is a fiscal agent report; this report includes examining planned v. actual expenses.  As noted above, in addition, next year, fiscal agent Vista USD will hold regular meetings regarding specific fiscal practices, reports, and deadlines among the member district's fiscal representatives and leadership council members.   

For the last three years, when the ETCN Leadership Council approved the budget for its CFAD submission, it also projected a budget for the following year. In March as we began working on the CFAD, each member district was asked to do two things:  1) to project its expenses through June 30, 2018 and 2) identify additional budget requests for 2018-19.  Based on the expenditure projections, any carry-over identified is then used to either carry incomplete activities into the next year, accelerate portions of the plan with later start dates, or support new budget requests. Members making additional budget requests are asked to identify whether the request is one-time, short-term or on-going, so the expense can be appropriately budgeted in future years.   

In addition to regular monthly meetings, the Leadership Council members participate in an annual planning retreat.  The retreat is used to amend and update our regional plan, while the regular Leadership Council meetings are used to monitor the implementation of the plan and tend to the business aspects of our consortium's operation.   
","The members of the ETCN believe we got it fairly close to “right” in our initial planning process over three years ago.  The data collected and the stakeholders assembled to identify and validate our region’s gaps and needs and the priorities and strategies to address those gaps and needs were critical to both the planning and implementation phases of our plan.  As a result, in order to gear up for the next three-year planning phase, we plan to repeat much of the process initially used; over the next year, we will update the data and research initially conducted and will reconvene the stakeholder groups.  
The major difference between the development of our first three-year plan and the next plan is the fact that we are now collecting and analyzing data and holding conversations with stakeholders consistently and regularly.  In the initial planning phase we had no baseline data.  As we plan for the next three years, we have not only baseline data, but also trending data, to measure growth and identify strategies that are working.  
Another difference is that, in our initial planning phase, we hired consultants to conduct research for us on labor market needs and on demographic needs by communities within our region.  This year, we will not need to hire consultants to do these studies for us.  With our consortium staff members in place, we have been able to update this data on an annual basis.  We rely on our Job Developer and Career Education Specialists to update our employer information and on our Data Coordinator to update student, demographic and labor market research data for us.  Also, ETCN has aligned our work with other regional planning initiatives and is able to leverage the labor market studies and research used to inform those other initiatives.  For example, members of the ETCN participate in the San Diego County Regional Career Pathways Consortium, the Strong Workforce Regional Task Force for the Southern Border Region, and the San Diego Workforce Partnership (our local workforce development board) regional planning processes.  
In October 2018, we plan to hold our fourth community forum.  At this community forum, community partners and local businesses will be invited to help us analyze gaps and needs, prioritize strategies, and identify potential leverage points and partnerships that could help to address those needs.  This year, we also plan to reconvene our faculty members and student focus groups.  "
"352","Lassen","4080","3","2019","“The Lassen-Modoc Adult Education Consortium (formerly Lassen County AB86 Consortium) is dedicated to meeting the needs of the community and local employers by providing adult education opportunities in Lassen and Modoc County.  Adult learners will complete high school diplomas or  equivalencies,  acquire and improve English Language development and literacy skills, and vocational skills with short-term CTE classes. By obtaining educational and employment skills this provides adult learners the opportunities to obtain meaningful employment and participate effectively as productive workers, family members, and citizens in the community.”
This was the Mission statement that the consortium adopted on May 16, 2014. 

The mission statement, vision and the goals of the consortium have remained  consistent moving forward from AB86 planning to AEBG  implementation and now into California Adult Education. The consortium agrees annually upon these goals and their top priorities by  allocating funding to service  each of the eight communities in their service region with AEBG adult education programs.   

The vision of the Lassen County AB86 Consortium agreed upon in 2014:
“Providing preparation and skills needed for employment, career advancement, continuing education, and personal growth for our local residents"". The vision aligns with the consortium goals  “To have a seamless way adults will complete their education and employment skills (diploma equivalency and vocational training) to enter the workforce.” 

Services for adult learners have been aligned between consortium member programs that include seven educational school districts, two county offices of education, the community college, one charter school, local agencies and workforce. Continuing with the 2017-18 year programs that offered literacy classes and workshops, ESL and citizenship classes,  high school diplomas or equivalency with GED or Hiset preparation and testing, and training instructional specialists/parents to assist school children; the consortium provides many educational opportunities for the adult learner.  The CTE offerings with employment skills include classes or workshops for computer applications and graphic arts, construction, welding,  automotive, and culinary/food service, CPR and basic firefighter safety, as requested by our regional employers.  

In May 2018 the consortium listened to twenty-five programs request funding for the  2018-19 school year. At the July 2018 consortium meeting the school district allocations were confirmed with agreement to fund eleven school sites with a variety of diploma equivalency programs, CTE short-term classes for basic employment skills, staff and parent training for student success, a Career Pathways program, a Parent University program, Jail Education programs in two counties, a Behavioral Health specialist and an AEBG Counselor.  

New goals for 2018-19 include:
1.   To ease the transition process for the adult learner we will align all consortium programs with pathways and referrals to higher education or employment.

2.  Utilize our student data collection to measure the student outcomes for the effectiveness of programs currently offered and design of future programs.

3. Develop more engagement and stronger partnerships between education, local agencies and workforce in the communities to align programs and meet employer's needs.

4. Create a marketing campaign for outreach to all rural communities in our service region to showcase programs currently offered.



","All of the consortium allocations align with our regional needs in our consortium's prior regional and annual plans. Diploma completions or equivalencies and short-term CTE classes for employment remain the top priorities. ESL and Literacy are needed for the diploma completions and citizenship tests. Theses are all reflected in our plans as pathways to employment.

Mini Grant Process for funding consortium programs
It was agreed upon by the consortium at their October 21, 2015 meeting to adopt the Mini Grant application process to decide on school district's allocation funding for AEBG programs. All mini grant applications will be brought to the consortium for approval of programs and funding. The mini grant developed for the consortium includes project description, objectives, activities, timelines, budget, performance outcomes and responsible persons. 

Continuing this mini grant application process has proved effective for the consortium with the communication for adult education program requests of each school district. Each allocation request is presented to the consortium, discussion and Q & A follow. A consortium review committee then meets to dissect the applications and sends their recommendations back to the consortium. The consortium then discusses the allocations and votes to approve or deny funding based on such factors as enrollments, outcomes and carryover funds remaining. The process involves everyone in the consortium and all school district members requesting funding.

With NOVA the school sites are inputting fiscal data and expenditures are reviewed for compliance with AEBG fiscal guidance. 
Each school district mini grant budget and expenditures are reviewed by the consortium fiscal office for program compliance with their allocation from the consortium. 


","To utilize the carryover funds the consortium has approved twenty mini grant programs in the  AEBG program areas for the 2018-19 year. During the first year (15-16) of AEBG only five mini grant programs were implemented. In the second year of AEBG (16-17) fifteen mini grant programs were implemented, and in the third year (17-18) of AEBG twenty programs were implemented. The growth of the consortium from five AEBG programs in five school districts to twenty AEBG programs in eleven districts is considerable for our small rural area. 

Support staff to service all of the consortium eleven school district sites has been hired for the 2018-19 school year. The consortium has hired an AEBG Counselor, Career Pathway Specialist, and contracted with a Behavioral Health Specialist to meet the needs of the adult learners in our service region. 

Additional carryover not utilized or accepted as a prior allocation has been re-distributed to school districts showing a need for increased funding in their AEBG programs, with increased student enrollments that require expanding existing classes to accommodate learners. As school districts implemented more programs the consortium improved their allocations using carryover funds to meet their increased adult education program needs.

","The advantage in developing the next 3-year plan due in May 2019, will be the ability to utilize the prior three year collection of student data from enrollments, outcomes and transitions to higher education or employment.  The review of school district member's prior allocations and fiscal expenditures for program offerings will provide data for each district's fiscal effectiveness. Comparing student enrollments and outcomes with the fiscal cost of programs at each school district will identify which school districts are providing adult education services successfully. All of this data was not available to analyze at the start of the program implementation in 2015 when the first 3-year regional plan was written. The consortium work groups will  confirm our consortium priorities are being met with effective programs and allocation expenditures are fiscally sound and both follow AEBG guidance.


Analyzing the student data collected for the past three years to identify student enrollments, completions, outcomes and transitions will  inform our consortium about the adult learner needs in regard to future planning. This compilation of student data will be used to make decisions for programming needs in our rural regional areas and benchmark which programs need to be expanded, revised or discontinued. With  a vast array of student data reports in the CASAS TE adult student database, the consortium will have access  to student outcomes and transitions. Comparing our collected student data with local labor market data in our service region will guide the consortium in making decisions about future adult program offerings. 



The consortium meetings will continue to be the recognizable forum in the community between adult education and workforce that link programs to local employment needs.  With the consortium membership of school districts and business partners a large networking group of professionals meet to discuss the regional needs of adult learners. The consortium will review the effectiveness of the implementation programs during the AEBG phase and evaluate the student successes and transitions in to higher education or job placements.

"394","West Hills","4122","3","2019","The West Hills Adult Education consortium (WHAEC) will continue to enhance educational programs and expand course offerings through its partnerships with educational institutions, workforce development organizations, employers and community members while focusing on student retention and success.  The 2017-2018 has demonstrated increased growth potential and expanded collaboration among board members, outside agencies, and the communities served.  This past year the consortium served 1,742 students, a significant increase from the previous year. Consortium member, Firebaugh Las Deltas Unified School District applied for and received ACS/WASC Accreditation, which will further enhance the post-secondary opportunities that come with an accredited program.  This has inspired another member, Reef Sunset Unified School District whom have already begun the process to become ACS/WASC accredited as well.  

Currently, six of our nine members offer diploma programs and one member offers High School Equivalency (HSE) preparation at four sites in the region. Additionally, four of our members provide ABE courses, which address the gap of high school attainment in this region.  All consortium members initiated CASAS pre and post-testing and will continue providing CASAS assessments for their ESL/ABE/ASE/HSE courses.  Additionally, all members will expand the tracking of their enrollments and enter student demographic information into the CASAS TOPSpro database as mandated by the State CAE office.  

Citizenship courses continue to expand as the demand continues to grow.  The WHAEC expanded their CTE trainings which included forklift certifications, truck driving and residential electrical. Two-hundred and fifty-nine (259) completed skills trainings.  A primary goal for our college members this year is to implement an ESL Certificate of Achievement, which will provide a pathway into either advanced CTE and/or Academic degree programs.  These four level ESL classes will be offered as non-credit at both WHC-Coalinga and WHC-Lemoore. Additional goals include expanding courses for immigrants such as ESL, Citizenship, and Computer Technology; we will also expand ABE/ASE/HSE availability in the rural communities and expand offerings of high demand short-term CTE courses. 
The consortium approved hiring a consortium level career pathways advisor. They will disseminate consortium, college, and partner agencies programs, career options, develop ed plans and set long-term goals .","
Member expenditures align well with overall goals of addressing the gaps in services in our region as stated in our 2018-2019 Annual Plan and our 3-Year Plan.  Some members experienced administrative and staffing turnover, thus did not expend ideal number of AEBG dollars due to these delays.  All members are on schedule to expand course offerings with no concerns of utilizing the funds in the allotted timelines.
","Two of the nine WHAEC members fully expended their 2017-2018 funds.  Seven consortium members with carry-over funds have scheduled activities to utilize their 2017-2018 carry-over funds in the 2018-2019 year. This will be accomplished by expanding the number of courses/programs and are prepared to expend 2017-2018 well within guidelines. Most members plan to increase the number of CTE course offerings as well in the communities they serve.","
The West Hills Adult Education Consortium is currently working on the next 3-year plan by creating a workgroup that is responsible for confirming our region’s needs continue being met and the offerings are still in alignment. The workgroup is compiling and analyzing data needed to generate a thorough narrative descriptive of continued adult education needs in our region. The workgroup along with the WHAEC members hope to have a better understanding of how to utilize all workforce partners, community organizations and further identify available regional resources to best impact and serve our communities members.  Additionally, our workgroup will utilize current member enrollment and outcome data tracked through the TOPspro database to create a model 3-year plan for our region.

"395","West Kern","4123","3","2019","The vision of this Consortium is to provide adult education in western Kern County with a strong emphasis on education services relating to English as a second language, citizenship preparation, short-term career technical training, and basic skills needed for academic and career success.
During the prior program year we met many of our program goals including:
Aligning regional academic and career pathways leading to employment and post-secondary education and/or the workforce.
WKAEN has collaborated closely with industrial and educational partners to develop strategic pathways for our students.
Evidence of this is reflected in new and innovative course development in Career Technical Education. Taft College, Taft Union High School and WKAEN collaborated together to develop and offer the following short-term CTE courses:
Personal Care Aide forty-hour course provides the graduates with the skills to obtain entry level employment in the home health care field. 
Welder’s Helper forty hours course provides an overview of the necessary safety, theory, and practical Lab experiences associated with local industry types of welding processes.  
Basic computer forty-hour course provides basic computer training and the foundation for education, training students to be computer literate in the work field, and promote short- term and long–term computer skills.  
Security Guard Card forty hour provides an opportunity for students to be trained and certified in the Guard card and Gun Safety / Self-Defense program with transitions into Taft College Criminal Justice program and the work field.  
Fork Lift Certification eight-hour course provides safety instructions specific to the field, to prepare students for the work field, and to certify students with the training and knowledge of Fork Lifting.
Drivers Ed Preparation 64 hour course targets adults with disabilities and prepares them to pass the DMV written exam.





-Community outreach development is key in our success. We plan to increase our efforts to attend local outreach events as well as enhanced visibility in local social media groups. We expect this to result in consistent growth in class size as well as increased traffic through our office by prospective students.
-Development of relevant ESL course offerings will be a priority. We have developed a comprehensive ESL program which resulted in three levels of effective ESL offerings.  A priority of this year’s ESL program includes reaching new students.","The planned allocations are consistent with the annual adult education plan which is based on our AEBG 3-year plan as follows: 1. Programs in elementary and secondary skills, including those leading to a high school diploma or high school equivalency certificate. 2. Programs for immigrants in citizenship, ESL, and workforce preparation. 3. Programs for adults, including, but not limited to, older adults, that are primarily related to entry or reentry into the workforce. 4. Programs for adults, including, but not limited to, older adults, that are primarily designed to develop knowledge and skills to assist elementary and secondary school children to succeed academically in school. 5. Programs for adult with disabilities. 6. Programs in career technical education that are short term in nature with high employment potential. 7. Programs offering pre-apprenticeship training conducted in coordination with one or more apprenticeship programs approved by the Division of Apprenticeship Standards.","WKAEN has incorporated remaining funds  into the implementation of courses in all programs areas.
CTE Workforce Readiness: WKAEN has developed short-term CTE pilot courses in several areas which will serve the unemployed adults in our  communities with the skills to obtain entry level employment as well as create pathways into post-secondary education and upper level Career Technical Education.  Investing carry-over funds on the initial supplies and curriculum for these courses will ensure that the courses will be sustainable.  Professional Development: WKAEN will also invest in the professional development of their instructors and support staff by providing ongoing training opportunities that will insure staff and teachers continue to be educated in best practices and improved student learning outcomes. We expect all 2016-17 unspent funds to be spent by December 2018.","Our planning process for the next 3-year plan will be different from the original process in that we have established a core schedule of classes within the seven AEBG program areas.  We plan on building on our successes and bringing  enhancement to the courses we have established.

"338","Tri-Cities","4066","3","2019","The Tri City Adult Education Consortium continues to work toward creating seamless pathways that help learners secure heightened levels of language preparation and short-term career entry.  Since the 2015-2016 year, tremendous progress has been made in establishing the core criteria of our consortium through building a common mission and purpose.  Fast-forward to the 2017-2018 year and it is immediately apparent that progress has been made in the areas of creating seamless pathways, curriculum alignment in ESL, establishing a shared sense of professional development for faculty and the Board, as well as creating opportunities to accelerate students to the community college through our upcoming Cosmetology dual enrollment course offering at Paramount Adult School. The current planned allocations for the 2018-2019 program year are an outgrowth of our collective work stemming from the prior three-year adult education plan and we are committed to establishing converging programs of study that create increasing opportunities for development and advancement in the adult school population.  Tri City Consortium connects education and workforce training to create family sustaining careers.  With this mission in mind, we work collectively to carry out our core vision of being data driven, operating as a benefit to the entire consortium, ensuring that we leverage our resources, identify core gaps that need to be filled, a reliance on the plans approved by the Board, a commitment to work through activities toward outcomes, ensuring that opportunities can be taken to scale,  and finally, ensuring that our institutions are using resources to create supplemental opportunities  and not supplanting.  To this end, the 2017-2018 year included a number of firsts for our consortium, including hosting the CCCCO Sponsored Increasing Rigor Across Adult Education training at Compton College, offering our first Curriculum Alignment PD for ESL faculty that will result in articulation agreement development, continued focus on the medical pathway in phlebotomy and the senior care industry, a new focus on Cosmetology being offered at Paramount Adult School, computer technology courses that will blend into the college Business Information Worker pathway, and a new training area of focus in non-destructive testing, which leads to living wage employment.  A renewed focus will be placed on soft-skills through the New World of Work and outreach workshops will be offered at each site.","The planned allocations are in alignment with the previous AEBG 3-year plan and validated through stakeholder communication and vetting at the 2018 Tri City Board Member Retreat.  Our current plan submission is in alignment with our initial plan and exhibits growth over the past three years of implementation.   Efforts have been made to not cannibalize one another's program and each member is able to freely communicate their frustrations or challenges regarding programmatic offerings.   As each of our institutions has on-boarded new administrative  support to fulfill the implementation of our plan, it is expected that our planned allocations will more accurately reflect the type of robust programmatic offering necessary to produce significant outcomes for our population.  Each of our programs seeks to produce measurable skills gains that result in positive outcomes for the citizenry of our districts.  Compton College has agreed to offer tutoring at each of the adult schools to support the academic development of students at the adult schools.  Efforts are also underway to identify a robust tool that will provide students with access to a pathway between their adult schools and the community college.  These efforts will provide more real-time data to help offer integrated support services to students while defining their exit plan. Ultimately, the four entities that make up the Tri City Consortium will continue to align critical course content and create clearer pathways that will facilitate transition to the workforce or Compton College. ","Carry-over funds for each of our consortium participants have been identified for instructional and programmatic use in the coming year.  They will be utilized to offer increased training in areas that promote job entry and preparation for more advanced paths.  Use of the quarterly expenditure projections serve as a great guide in allocating funding for initiatives that create a direct impact on WIOA metrics and State of California outcomes.  ","Since none of the current Board representatives were part of the past 3-year plan development, we plan to hold a Board retreat in order to address the components of the 3-year plan.  Now that consortium members have a year under their belt the foundation has been laid to focus on a shared activity in each of the seven areas represented by the California Adult Education program (HSD completion, job placement , improved literacy, increased wages, transition from noncredit to credit and Adult School to Post-Secondary,  and increase Post-Secondary Certifications-Degrees-Training).  The Board has brainstormed programmatic and curricular activities under each of these categories and will consider for prioritizing for potential implementation."
"329","Antelope Valley","4057","3","2019","The overarching mission of the Antelope Valley Regional Adult Education Consortium (AVRAEC) is to strengthen all areas of adult education in the Antelope Valley.   
As we move into year three of the performance phase, the AVAERC remains committed to our collaboratively determined priorities of the consortium and community:  
1. Maintaining current successful programs offered by members of the consortium is our number one priority.  While the consortium recognizes a need for growth in many areas, it also recognizes a need to maintain programs that are thriving and servicing adults of the region now.   
2. The consortium feels that supporting growth in the following areas will give the region the greatest gains: 
-	Career Technical Education and Apprenticeships  
-	English as a Second Language and workforce preparation
-	Adult Basic Education  
-	Adults with Disabilities  
-	We have incorporate the two additional program areas for older adults into each of these areas   
","We have developed a proposal process where educational organizations can request funds for a specific program or purpose.  These proposals are reviewed and voted on by the membership.  Proposals must meet the needs of the region as outlined in the annual and three year plans.  ","Carry-over funds are treated the same as the normal allocation.  To access these funds, an educational organization would develop a proposal that would be reviewed and voted on by the membership.  This proposal would have to meet the goals of the region as outline in the annual and three-year plans.","The consortium membership is currently working to set a plan of action to complete the three year plan.  The original plan was developed from the work completed while writing the regional needs assessment.   We are developing a calendar of events to bring in community members to assist us in review and developing the three year plan."
"348","Salinas Valley","4076","3","2019","In program year 18-19, the SVAEC will continue the work it did in 17-18 to offer comprehensive adult education services throughout the region. In the new program year there will be even more emphasis on outreach and marketing; counseling and transition support; basic literacy and digital literacy instruction; and workforce development through job training & placement programs and stronger industry partnerships. 

Great gains have been made and the SVAEC will continue to meet the objectives of AB104 by employing the strategies in our three-year plan. Gaps in service are being filled by increasing the amount of ESL, basic literacy, ABE/ASE, HSE, HSD, citizenship, and digital literacy instruction as well as the diversification of course levels, schedules, and locations. Programs are being aligned and student transitions facilitated by ongoing curriculum alignment; standardization of intake, assessment, and data collection/reporting practices; and improved support for adult learners transitioning to college or the workforce. Students are progressing faster due to blended learning strategies and the use of instructional technology; increased offerings of short-term CTE programs; and contextualized academic support for CTE students.

Some accomplishments to highlight from this past year include increased services in the county jail by MCOE & Hartnell College, including more HiSET instruction & testing, new workforce readiness & pre-CTE instruction, new college classes, and new college & career pathways support for inmates before and after release; new Forklift Certification and Food Safety Certification classes at Gonzales Adult School; a new Registered Dental Assistant program and planning for a Community Health Worker program at Soledad Adult School; collaboration by Salinas Adult School with Project Search, an internship program for adults with disabilities; new noncredit ESL courses at Hartnell; increased Citizenship Prep courses throughout the region with great success – North Monterey County Adult School alone had 27 students pass the Citizenship Exam; new bilingual computer classes in King City provided collaboratively by South Monterey County Adult School & Hartnell; and new basic English & Spanish literacy courses started at North Monterey County, Salinas, and Gonzales Adult Schools. 

Now with a stronger foundation established, the SVAEC’s primary goal is to increase student enrollment, completion, and progression.","Activities in the 3-year plan, the consortium annual plan, and the individual member workplans all align. The member budgets and the consortium shared fund budget all support the activities in the plans, with the majority of expenditures going to teacher and support staff salaries for direct student services like instruction and student intake and assessment. ","The carryover is being integrated in Member Workplans. However, a new policy was adopted by the Consortium on 8.8.18 to automatically reallocate carryover after 18 months of the original issue date (e.g. 17-18 funds must be spent by December 2018 or else reallocated) to ensure funds are spent in a timely manner. Some carryover from the Consortium Shared Funds will likely be made available sooner than December for Members to apply for additional funding. ","The following activities will be conducted for developing the next 3-year regional plan: Use findings from the Salinas Valley Adult Education Needs Assessment and Environmental Scan conducted in 2018 and other regional data to inform the Plan; continue the work of the Consortium Planning Workgroup and Data & Accountability Workgroup; incorporate recommendations from the Consortium Professional Learning Communities; consider work done by our consortium’s Human-Centered Design Team and research and development they may do in the future; leverage existing consortium, member district, and partner advisory activities, e.g. LCAP meetings, adult school community advisory meetings, student surveys, OneStop Core Partner meetings, etc.; hold a Consortium Planning Retreat; incorporate planning into regular Steering Meetings throughout the year; align Plan with the Monterey County Workforce Development Board Regional Plan; consider Hartnell College and BACCC initiatives such as Strong Workforce, Perkins, SSSP, SEP, BSI, etc., regional initiatives such as the WDB Project Slingshot and the new CWDB Corrections-Workforce Partnership, and regional studies by CAEL conducted for the MCWDB and MBEP and by MDRC for the Irvine Foundation; and utilize resources provided by the AEBG and AEBG TAP offices, CCAE, CATESOL, COABE, and other state and national associations and initiatives. 

This process will differ greatly from that of the development of the original 3-year plan. This time we will have more information to guide our planning, including more regional demographic data; data from regional adult education-specific research; input from stakeholders; knowledge of our gaps, barriers, assets, and opportunities; knowledge of best practices and effective models; and important lessons learned from our successes and failures the last three years. "
"378","South Bay (San Jose Evergreen)","4106","3","2019","Development/implementation of the 18-19 plan is facilitated by the collaborative structures of SBCAE. The Steering Committee, with faculty representation from both systems, meets twice a month. These reps assure that allocations are made consistent with the regional and annual plans. Other SBCAE groups include: a Consultation Council, with faculty and classified reps from all members; a network of 15 Transition Specialists from all members; 4 faculty workgroups with reps from all members; and a data team from both systems.  These groups regularly evaluate the progress of the 9 project workplans and their coherence to the Regional Plan: SBCAE’s Vision of a “no wrong door” system of adult education with clear and easily navigable pathways for adults as they progress from basic skills into training and family-sustaining employment with courses that accelerate progress with systems of targeted supports. SBCAE is also committed to specific supports for immigrants to achieve greater integration into their communities, and for students with learning differences to receive appropriate instruction and support. A central guiding principle has always been to focus on the needs of students, not on institutions. Other accomplishments this year include: transition specialists working together to expand support services; an adults with disabilities specialist supporting all members; college classes co-located at adult schools;  web-based navigation resources for students; piloting supports/metrics for immigrant integration; CTE bridge classes; colleges joining 3 adult schools in a WIOA consortium; curriculum development and articulation in ESL and Basic Skills; community outreach; data and accountability, and professional development, including special focus on adults with disabilities and Human Centered Design.  Primary goals for 18-19 will build on these 9 project areas – some activities will be extended from last year, and some new activities emerged from what we learned. A new priority for 18-19 is to explore how other funds may be leveraged. Also, in 18-19 we will work to better define and measure what’s effective. These nine revised project workplans, distilled in the responses to Regional Needs and subsequent Strategies below, express the primary goals for the 18-19 annual plan.  Our mission is embodied in these projects and ongoing review affirms that current allocations are used by all members to carry out the activities listed in the project workplans.","The current governance structure of the SBCAE offers many opportunities for discussion of both the broad goals, objectives of the Regional Plan, and the more detailed strategies and activities of what the consortium has called Project Area workplans. Continual reference is made to what’s being accomplished in the Project Areas, what resources are used, and what resources are still needed. The alignment of resources/allocations to the Regional Plan and Annual Plan iterations of that Plan, is referenced regularly in bi-monthly Steering Committee meetings, and other meetings of the Consultation Council (the representative advisory body of faculty and staff from all nine institutions), the faculty workgroups, the Transition Specialists networks, and whenever meetings with community partners are held.  For adult schools, the function of the adult schools’ programs is Tier 1 Priority of the Regional Plan, and their allocations are relatively transparently aligned to both the Regional Plan and the Annual Plans.  A part of some members’ annual allocations are intended to support consortium-wide activities, as outlined in the annual and regional plans.  The annual process for assigning allocations to each member follows the guidelines of AB104, identifies programs expenditures and resources needed for consortium-wide functions, and assures that all allocations will align to the Annual Plan. The current Regional Plan outlines the tiers of priorities for expenditures, given that our vision and goals exceed the resources we have.
    
Each board-appointed representative of the colleges and adult schools is responsible to the Steering Committee to assure that all AEP allocations are expended in ways that produce AEP results and are able to be tracked to the objectives and strategies of the Regional Plan and the Annual Plans.  The need to make all members completely accountable motivates the process described in the next section, as we deal with carry-over funding. ","In Summer 2018 the Co-Chairs of the consortium, assisted by the Executive Director, are developing a form and process for all members to report what additional funds remain and how they will be used to address the regional needs and achieve the goals specified in the SBCAE’s Regional Plan. This will not be unprecedented, in that regular reference has been made in all governance processes of the need to align expenditures to the Regional Plan.  As requests have been received for expenditures not outlined by the plans, SBCAE acknowledged the need for more accountability for carry-over funds, indeed for all AEP allocations and the search for leveraged funds.","Our consortium has learned a lot from our work together and from our community partners in the last three years and we will build the new Regional Plan on that foundation.  Some information gathering for the planning process will be similar to the last process.  We will study new regional data, both the workforce data from our local Workforce Development Boards, and all other regional job market data from other sources. We’ve set a goal of understanding more deeply the demographics of our region, as evidenced in our intentional focus on the diverse needs of immigrants. This work has developed public and private partnerships which will support our regional planning.

Qualitative data used to inform our regional plan will be produced from multiple “focus interviews” with key leaders in our region; social services, criminal justice system, homeless and foster youth system, and workforce leaders both in the public sector and private industry.  We will again convene multiple focus groups of students and community partners.  Already we have used a student survey to capture student reflections on what we are doing well and what can be improved.  We will feed these topics back to student leaders facilitating the student focus groups.
  
After three years we believe our internal structure of collaborative groups of representatives from all members and all disciplines will be critical to the development of the regional plan.  Our Steering Committee, the Consultation Council, our Faculty Work Groups, our network of Transition Specialists, and our Data Team will all be critical to assess what has been effective, what needs to be new and different, and what constitutes the next Regional Plan.  It is our goal to have these groups, which will continue to function in the next three years, be the drivers of the plan, and in this sense the plan will be generated from, implemented by, and sustained by those adult educators who are doing the work on the ground.

Last year we held a consortium-wide professional development day focusing on Human Centered Design, deeply engaging us in these principles focusing on the grounded-experience of students.  Our consortium had a team doing further training on HCD in June and July. It is our intention to imbue the production of our next regional plan with this attention.  The first guiding principle of the SBCAE Charter is, “Focus on the needs of adult education students first.”  That will continue to be our NorthStar going forward."
"346","Glendale","4074","3","2019","The Glendale Community College District Regional Consortium was branded in Program Year (PY) 2016-2017, as Glendale Local Education and Resource Network Services (GlendaleLEARNS). GlendaleLEARNS entered PY 2017-2018 focused on expanding access to adult education and driving innovation throughout its programs and services. These efforts are in alignment with its vision of: All adult learners will have access to education through collaboration, shared resources, career pathways, seamless services and innovative programs, to meaningful employment or higher education. 

GlendaleLEARNS established goals for PY 2017-2018 to achieve its vision including: expand access to ESL courses throughout the community, expand programs available to adults with disabilities (AWD), continue co-enrollment with WIOA and other partners, implement job development for adult education students, and continue professional development to drive innovation in programs. The Consortium established five Committees to address established goals and strategies. The Committees developed Action Plans based on its Annual and Three-Year Plans and continue to revise and implement them throughout each PY.  

The Committees completed 86% of their Action Plans established for PY 2017-2018 Annual Plan. Actions completed included integrating partnerships to expand services to students with multiple barriers and offering a job development service for those students wanting to focus on employment. ESL courses were expanded and are now offered throughout the community in partnership with the Verdugo Workforce Development Board (VWDB), Verdugo Jobs Center (VJC), International Rescue Committee (IRC) and Glendale Library Arts and Culture (Library). One of the most notable accomplishments was the use of Human Centered Design to develop a co-enrollment process and implemented the process with a universal application that allows students to enroll with multiple partners and funding sources to meet their educational and employment needs.

Based on successes achieved in PY 2017-2018 and identified needs in the region, GlendaleLEARNS is committed to continue expanding services to students with multiple barriers including: English Language Learner students, students needing Adult Basic Education (ABE) or Adult Secondary Education (ASE), and AWDs. GlendaleLEARNS will continue working with its partners to continue its innovative co-enrollment of students in WIOA and non-WIOA funding sources. 
","All allocations as detailed in our CFAD and Member Plans, and approved by the GlendaleLEARNS Board of Directors, are consistent with the annual adult education plan which is based on our Three-Year Plan. This ensures that all expenditures are in compliance with AB104 and directly benefit or support student learning and goal achievement. Staff salaries are focused on instructors delivering instruction and/or coordination and support of program development, partner coordination and delivery of services to students. Similarly, other expenses include the tracking and reporting of AEBG services, other services to students including job development and job placement assistance, and materials and supplies for program operation and delivery of instruction.","Using the FIFO method for expenditures, we expect any carryover funds to be expended in accordance with established guidelines and deadlines (i.e. 60% expenditure of carryover and new funds by Q4). Continued implementation of the GlendaleLEARNS Annual Plan and Three-Year Plan, ensures that all expenditure goals will be met in PY 2018-2019.","GlendaleLEARNS will use the tools provided on the California Adult Education (CAE) website, including the Process Map.  These tools were not used to develop the initial Three-Year Plan; however, the overall process is similar.

Establish Planning Mindset:  This step began with the Annual Plan preparation with the review of GlendaleLEARNS Mission, Vision, Values and an assessment of current accomplishments and gaps. Small group exercises were used to conduct the assessment, review Action Plans, and gather input from the members and partners. These exercises served as an introduction to the three-year planning process. Each monthly meeting will include a planning exercise to continue gathering input and moving through the process map.

Understand Where You Are:  Similar to the initial Three-Year Plan, an environmental scan will be conducted including local demographics, economic environment, labor market information, and the business climate. Information will be used to conduct a SWOT analysis.  Results will be fed into the development of strategies and tactics.

Immersion in the Problem: GlendaleLEARNS will be working with its VWDB partner as well as the Los Angeles Basin Regional Planning Unit (LABRPU) to integrate planning efforts.  The VWDB and LABRPU are now working on the modification of the Local and Regional Workforce Development Plans, as required by the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) and the California Workforce Development Board. The VWDB and LABRPU will hold multiple townhall meetings to gather input from key stakeholders including partners, business representatives, elected officials, and customers/students. GlendaleLEARNS will capitalize on these townhall meetings to gather stakeholder input for the AEBG Three-Year Plan due in June 2019.  The GlendaleLEARNS Coordinator is also VWDB staff and will be responsible for writing the Local Plan modification as well as the Three-Year Plan. Therefore, the Coordinator will ensure that any information that is needed for the Three-Year Plan is included in the agenda and focus group exercises. 

Strategies and Tactics:  Data and information gathered from the environmental scan, SWOT and the townhall meetings will be used to develop the strategies and tactics for the Plan. This information will then be used to revise Action Plans that are cascaded to the five Committees that implement the Plan throughout the year.

"335","West End Corridor","4063","3","2019","The vision of the West End Corridor Consortium continues to be one of providing comprehensive, relevant, and high-quality education and training in serving the needs of adults in the region.  This is accomplished through the leveraging of resources focused on providing viable career pathways and seamless transitions to post-secondary and vocational programs, increased accessibility through a variety of schedules and modalities, and attention to the acceleration of student progress through program integration and co-location of classes.  The Consortium is committed to student-centered approaches to access and guidance, as measured through outcome data and student and staff surveys.  The Inland Empire is still one of the fastest growing regions in the state, with a constant need for qualified individuals to join the ever-expanding and changing workforce.  By keeping up-to-date with regional economic and workforce trends, providing in-demand programs, taking students’ barriers to success into account, and providing meaningful professional development, the West End Corridor is accomplishing the goals set forth in its Plan.

For the 2018-19 program year, the West End Corridor Consortium priorities and allocations remain consistent with the strategies that were identified in the initial Three-Year Plan.  These fall within the overarching concept of workforce preparation through the development of career pathways, improved outreach and accessibility, increased transition opportunities, a greater variety of short-term CTE offerings, strong foundational literacy and basic skills programs, the attainment of secondary credentials, and the integration of basic workforce and technology skills across programs.

Accomplishments:  Program growth; increased technology and software; web-based CASAS testing; increased HSE and industry certification testing; career planning focus through software and career centers; orientation and transition counseling; increased collaboration among agencies; dual-enrollment opportunities & program integration; support for professional development; WEC Program Coordinator

Primary Goals:  Next 3-Year Plan; focused marketing plan and budget; increased offerings to address student demand and learning modalities; expansion of career education and services; increased focus on professional development and use of data to drive instruction & program design; increased collaboration with community college, including tracking student transitions

","Providing in-demand and regionally relevant training for adults in the western portion of the Inland Empire remains the mission of the West End Corridor consortium as described in its original Three-Year Plan.  Resource allocation has always been determined by consensus with consideration to the strengths and limitations of each agency, volume of students served, community resources/needs, and potential for the leveraging of resources.  Duplication of programs where there is a clear need, such as ESL, ABE and ASE, results in increased modalities and collaboration among agencies.  CTE program development is being examined more from a regional perspective, with agencies using resources to “fill in the gaps.”  In addition to designing programs that are responsive to student needs, allocations are being devoted to enhance data collection and accountability efforts, student counseling and transitions, staff development and collaboration, acceleration of student progress, and articulation/pathways to post-secondary and workforce training providers.  These are all areas addressed in the Three-Year Plan, and significant progress has been made or original goals have been met or exceeded.

The West End Corridor follows the fiscal-agent model and maintains a central account destined for consortium-wide expenses.  The system has worked well, as it provides the financial flexibility necessary for support of projects that benefit all members.  These include hiring a Program Coordinator, attendance at local, regional and state conferences, contracting with Adult Education Solutions (AES), financing student data software such as TE and ASAP, financing consortium events, and supporting staff professional development.  WEC membership meets regularly to review and approve allocations, including any necessary budget modifications. Input from stakeholders, including student and staff surveys, is taken into account when making decisions regarding resource allocation.  Carrying out of Plan objectives has been further strengthened by the WIOA II program and MOU with the local Workforce Development Board.  These relationships will serve to provide essential collaboration and program components that will assist the WEC in achieving its regional goals. 
","The West End Corridor Consortium of agencies has a plan for the appropriate and agreed upon use of any carry-over funds.  The leveraging of remaining funds will further the development of the 3-Year Plan, program expansion as described in this plan and capital projects directly associated with plan objectives.   These capital projects have been impacted by normal local/state policy and procedure and will be coming to fruition in the coming year.  Instructional space, facility enhancement to accommodate growth, and career center facilities and staffing are critical projects to be completed in the coming year.   Carry-over funds will also be used to expand existing data tools through professional development for staff and students, platforms for identifying and communicating with current and former students, support for transitions to college and the workforce, and the creation of a strategic marketing plan and activities.  Integrated English Language Civics Education (IELCE) program initiation efforts of the WIOA member agencies will leverage programs and services of the college and ROP members to enhance workforce training opportunities for ESL students.  ","The West End Corridor consortium has already started the initial process of formulating the next Three-Year Plan by establishing a planning mindset.  The Consortium held a meeting on August 1 in which past accomplishments and future goals were discussed.  A second planning meeting is scheduled for September 12. This will be a half-day meeting where a minimum of Consortium business will be conducted.  Three hours have been set aside for creation of a “roadmap” that will guide the writing of the new Three-Year Plan.
The West End Corridor consortium is a much more cohesive group than it was three years ago.  It is also larger, with the addition of Baldy View ROP.  Chaffey College now has a Director of Adult Education and High School Partnerships who is a voting member of the group, and this has vastly improved communication with the college.  Since there is already a Three-Year Plan in place, and the corresponding Annual Plans, it is expected that the process of writing the next Three-Year Plan will be much smoother, and that the resulting Plan will be more detailed and focused.
Throughout the coming year, collaboration time will be scheduled regularly to work on the Plan.  It is anticipated that at least 4 physical meetings, frequent online collaboration, and a possible retreat, will be necessary to produce the Plan.  The Program Coordinator will be responsible for scheduling meetings and providing the necessary resources and materials, in addition to writing and providing sections of the plan for review.  Work groups with expertise in a given area may also provide input and advise the core members.
The Program Coordinator and others have attended webinars in which the Annual Plan and the Three-Year Plan have been discussed.  Materials have been obtained from the Cal Adult Ed website that will help with the writing of the Plan.  These will be made available to members so they will have a clear idea of the format and objectives of the Plan.

Major steps in the planning process include:
	A review of the original Three-Year Plan
	An analysis of where we are, where we have been, and where we are going
	An analysis of gaps/weaknesses/needs
	A look at changes in regional demographics since the original Plan
	A study of the effectiveness of fiscal and other resource allocation
	Stakeholder input

"388","Sonoma","4116","3","2019","In preparation for the new three year adult education plan, Sonoma County Adult Education Consortium (SCAEC) members participated in a strategic planning session and a Stakeholder’s Meeting in order to solicit information about how to best serve shared constituents.  This was necessary, as the firestorm that engulfed the community in October 2017 has changed priorities for many agencies.  Housing, food and job insecurity due to the loss of over 5,300 homes, 700 non-residential buildings and 600 businesses has stretched the resources of local agencies and has impacted student retention and completion.  The fires also impacted employment for construction and trades that must be addressed for the county to recover emotionally and economically.
Keeping this in mind, the Oversight established some broad long-term (3-year) goals, as well as short-term goals for the current academic year. Our long-term goals include:
1.	Expand or deepen partnerships with Community Based Organizations, School Districts, and local governments to better serve students in closer proximity to home
2.	Develop and implement non-credit and adult school online course offerings for high school diploma/equivalency, ESL, and Career Education
3.	Facilitate collaboration and articulation between SCOE and Petaluma Adult School with SRJC to increase matriculation to post-secondary education and non-credit certificate completion
4.	Align sequencing of adult school computer instruction with SRJC to increase non-credit certificate completion
5.	Expand construction and trades related training options through the development, approval and implementation of new courses and certificate programs to meet Rebuild Sonoma County efforts
6.	Identify and implement continuing professional development for faculty, staff and administrators of adult education and non-credit programs aligned with the seven program areas
7.	Establish a deeper connection with north bay and bay area consortiums to increase awareness of opportunities for students throughout the region and provide a greater support network of resources to our consortium partners

The SCAEC is a direct-funded partnership.  Each agency has allocated funding based on the services their agency provides and in keeping with the overall Regional Plan for Adult Education. To this end, the Oversight Committee identified nine key areas of focus for the 2018/19 academic year:
1.	Maintain and support ESL, HSD/HSE, and family literacy programs
2.	Expand Workforce Preparation and Career Education industry area offerings to align with regional workforce need
3.	Establish and utilize Community Pro software to connect agencies to provide wrap-around services
4.	Recruit and hire qualified testing technicians to assist with data collection through the CASAS pre and post testing process
5.	Regularly schedule Outreach Specialists at existing education/resource centers to assist students with work/school transitions
6.	Develop a process to continue to collect data on gaps in service provision, and provide an updated needs assessment by June 2019
7.	Provide professional development, as well as resource information, to instructors on barriers to student engagement, retention and completion that include, but are not limited to the following topics: housing, food and transportation insecurity; child and elderly care; addiction and mental health issues; and domestic abuse
8.	Establish a north county hub with space to possibly include a family resource center
The Oversight Committee also reflected upon the accomplishments of the SCAEC for the 2017/18 academic year:
1.	Petaluma Adult School expanded the HSD program into Sonoma Valley and Santa Rosa with over sixty high school graduates.
2.	SCOE implemented the Intro to Construction course in Santa Rosa and Sonoma to immediately address training needs for construction workers post-fires.  One hundred students have completed the fifty-hour course. 
3.	Strengthened partnerships with La Luz and Job Link to provide wrap-around services to students in the Construction courses.
4.	Established a multi-media presence for SCAEC using several social media platforms, print materials and radio advertising.
5.	Established the SCAEC website in August 2017 (English/Spanish) to provide general information a
",\n,\n,"The Sonoma County Adult Education Consortium started community engagement for the updated three-year plan in May 2018.  Community engagement will consist of a series of Stakeholder meetings that will both bring all potential partners to the table in one room, as well as provide forums for subgroups to discuss in more detail the specifics of what is needed/required for each service provision area under the Adult Education Programs funding legislation.  
Community engagement will occur for the next six to eight months, then the focus will switch to the Oversight Committee to take the input and formalize it into a comprehensive three year plan. The first strategic planning meeting of the Oversight Committee took place in June 2018, where the year one plan was discussed, as well as how we would go about developing the three-year plan. 
In addition, we have nurtured critical relationships with the Workforce Development Board and the Economic Development Board, which have provided data and feedback on training and support service gaps in the community that could potentially be addressed through Adult Education partnerships. We are using local Economic Development state of Sonoma County reports that were updated after the wildfires in October 2017 to respond to changing needs for the local workforce and address lingering holes in employment training for our community.  We will also better engage our Office of Institutional Research regarding student retention and completion data, particularly in comparison to like Consortium and Colleges.
The main difference in how we are forecasting for the second regional plan is that we have financial data to understand what we can afford to offer or address each year of the plan, and build in more efficiencies to sustain current programs.

Preliminary student data report for the program year 2017-18 reveals that the unduplicated number of 15,030 adult learners in the region enrolled with CAERC member agencies and received services. The number of learners who demonstrated measurable skill gains is 8,309 and is included in 10,108 AEBG outcomes achieved. 
In April 2017, the Sacramento Employment & Training Agency (SETA) – a CAERC partner – was awarded one of the California Workforce Development Board’s English Language Learner (ELL) Workforce Navigator grants. Four CAERC members partnered with SETA to support ELLs through this innovative joint education/workforce initiative.  As of August 2018, there are 146 enrolled in our ELL Workforce Navigator Pilot up through June 30.  104 are co-enrolled in WIOA Title II Adult Education programs, of which: 97 are enrolled in ESL or VESL (primarily ESL), 8 are enrolled in Adult Basic Education (ABE) and 6 are enrolled in high school completion/equivalency. 44 have entered employment with a $12.96 average wage at placement.  With six more months remaining in this pilot, SETA and CAERC members are making great strides. 
Another CAERC partner, Sacramento Public Library, has been serving a target population in the region though an online high school diploma program, as a result of the special project funds received by CAERC.  
In year 4, the consortium will continue and expand upon the efforts initiated in the first 3 years with the extended focus on Enhancing Services & Instruction. The consortium will work on the following strategies for 2018-19: 
1. Expand Adult Education Course Offerings in the 7 Program Areas in the Region.  
2. Coordinate and Expand Marketing and Outreach Efforts  
3. Use and Promote the Regional Asset Map  
4. Align Courses Across the Consortium and Streamline Pathways for Adult Learners. 
5. Increase K-12 Adult Education Transition to Postsecondary Education, Training and/or Employment with Student Outreach Events and Services.  
6. Expand Career Pathways Programming, Integrated Education & Training (IET) Offerings and Boot Camps Across the Region.  
7. Offer Professional Development to Support the Regional Strategies.  
8. Strengthen Regional Partnerships to Increase Funding and Leverage Existing Structures and Expertise to Benefit Adult Learners in our Region.  
9. Support data collection and reporting efforts and data-driven decision making in and outside of the class.","Planned allocations are consistent with the annual adult education plan because the primary strategy for all members continues to be the mandate and urgency to Expand Adult Education Course Offerings in the 7 Program Areas in the Region. ","The remaining carry-over funds will be reallocated to members who opt-in and according to the Governance Plan. ","Members have noted that the region has changed in the past three years, which will require us to re-evaluate some of our assumptions about student needs and how best to meet them. The improving economy coupled with a higher cost of living, the increasing demand for high-skilled workers, the expanded use of technology, along with increased immigration bring new challenges to adult education and community colleges.  This may require some new solutions and a further refinement of strategies.  K12 members have expressed the continued commitment to improving coordination and articulation with post-secondary education entities. Additionally, members propose to explore ways to better address the needs of our local business employers as they relate to the services we provide.  
As a consortium, we will take advantage of the mandates, trends, and projects at the national, state and regional levels to inform and support our 3-year planning process. These are some of the initiatives we will learn from: 
- the California WIOA Co-enrollment Cohort sponsored by US Department of Labor and US Department of Education; 
-  Human-centered design training facilitated by American Institute of Research and WestEd and Adult Education Program Office; 
-  July 2018 guidance by EDD on behalf of the State Workforce Board about Regional and Local Plans PY 17-21 – Two Year Modifications; 
- Immigrant Integration Framework by the ALLIES coalition of adult schools, community colleges, and community-based organizations in Silicon Valley;
- July 2018 national bipartisan overhaul of the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education (CTE) Act that includes key provisions to help working-age Americans build their skills and strengthen states' abilities to offer more career-technical or skills-based classes.

"379","San Luis Obispo","4107","3","2019","The San Luis Obispo Adult Education Consortium (SLOCAEC) has made significant headway over the past three years as we continue to persist in the implementation of the Regional Comprehensive Plan (RCP). The consortium continues to work collaboratively amongst members and partners to coordinate and develop an integrated adult education system across local school districts and the community college by leveraging resources, developing seamless transitions, implementing innovative strategies, and shared professional development opportunities that will support both new and existing adult education students. The consortium has worked efficiently and effectively to develop programs and strategies that connect the adult learner with regional resources and social services that guide and assist them with their educational goals while mitigating barriers to their success.
SLOCAEC has completed the restructure of existing programs, developed new programs, modified curriculum, and implemented supportive services to improve student success, accelerate learning, and increase successful course completion. Strategies to improve retention and persistence were implemented with success and noncredit counselors were hired at the Community College to assist with this strategy and process. Counseling at K-12 Adult Schools is imbedded into each student's individualized educational goals. 
Administrators, faculty, and staff attended various professional development opportunities with an emphasis on adult education and retention to provide input and identify best practices and strategies for our region's adult education learner.
Efforts continue to be made to leverage resources and close gaps in services and achievement gaps for students enrolled in adult education programs. K-12 districts have aligned curriculum and are developing Short-term Career Technical Education (CTE) programs. Cuesta College has increased the number of noncredit Career Development College Preparation (CDCP) programs with an emphasis on Short-Term CTE and Workforce Preparation with a high employability outcome. All districts have established a process that continues to develop and improve with America’s Job Center of California (AJCC) to ensure students are connected with employability opportunities that are in high demand in the San Luis Obispo County. 
SLOCAEC is proud to report that it has continued to persist to reach the vision and goals of the Regional Comprehensive Plan. 
","Our three year plan addressed the assessment and implementation process of the seven adult education programs areas. The 2018-2019 annual plan refines the three year plan by continuing to fund successful programs and strategies that promote student success. The annual plan will also prioritize outreach for increased program development and collaboration with community partners to continue leveraging resources.","All AEBG funds, both current and carry-over, are prioritized by greatest need and invested in successful programs and strategies that meet the AEBG 3-year plan.","SLOCAEC will begin research and assessing the needs of the region after the first RCP implementation to identify any service gaps within the adult education system. The consortium will leverage resources with current partners to continue its collaboration to rethink and redesign adult education in the San Luis Obispo County. The consortium will work with the Workforce Development Board (WDB), and use research from other agencies such as the RP Group and WestEd to identify effective and best practices based on data and evidence. The planning process will hopefully be more efficient and effective now that our consortium has three years of experience. We have identified the region's needs, learned through various professional development opportunities and developed collaborative partnerships in order meet those needs through quality adult education."

NCAEC's 2018-2019 annual plan activities focus on continuing collaborative efforts to improve adult learner access to high quality educational opportunities and career pathway support services. This year’s plan builds upon the accomplishments of 2017/2018 and will align with the consortium's upcoming 3-year plan.  For 2018-2019, NCAEC will continue to coordinate and develop an integrated adult education system across local school districts and the community college by leveraging resources, developing seamless transitions, implementing innovative strategies, and shared professional development opportunities that will support both new and existing adult education students. The consortium has worked efficiently and effectively and will continue to develop programs and strategies that connect the adult learner with regional resources and social services that guide and assist them with their educational goals while mitigating barriers to their success. NCAEC has developed new programs, modified curriculum, and implemented supportive services to improve student success, accelerate learning, and increase successful course completion.  NCAEC has and will continue to leverage funds to increase programs and services to students, increase access to programs through distance education platforms, and to increase the number of career opportunities through the development of short-term CTE programs.


","NCAEC's members continuously collaborate with community stakeholders and WIOA mandated partners throughout the year to gather input, evaluate resources and services, and assess student and program needs both locally and throughout the region.  Members begin conversations at the local level and share input with the consortium to create the three year plan.  During the three year plan discussions, long-term goals are developed.  The long-term goals help define the consortium investments and allocations.  Three year plan long term goals are used to develop the short-term goals of the annual plan.  All members participate in the development of the annual plan which aligns expenditures with consortium planned activities for the year.  Each member will work with their stakeholders to develop their member plan budget and expenditures which will align with consortium goals from the annual plan.     ","NCAEC members that carried-over funds plan on allocating the additional funds to cover the costs of maintaining and expanding programs and services; hiring additional staff to serve students, and creating additional opportunities for professional development and collaboration time.  Carry-over funds will assist with meeting the increased demand for adult programs and services and increased need for training.  NCAEC has new and veteran staff members that have little knowledge of data and accountability programs.  As previously mentioned collaboration time will need to occur in order to align curriculum and services between local and regional partners and members. These are all strategies planned for the upcoming year that will need additional investments.    ","NCAEC plans on including more critical stakeholders in the 3-year planning process this year.  NCAEC will gather input from members, partners and stakeholders in the region to develop its 3-year comprehensive adult education plan. To ensure that the plan addresses adult learner needs that are specific to local programs and the consortium, multiple meetings will be held throughout the region that focus on creating awareness of educational opportunities and services within the region, and learning about the characteristics and needs of NCAEC's student population. The leadership committee will drive the initial planning with the expectation that the planned strategies will address the regional needs, have measurable outcomes, and align with other major initiatives, such as WIOA, Strong Workforce, Student Success and Equity, and Guided Pathways.  The 3-year goals and strategies will be vetted by the NCAEC community partners and approved by the NCAEC Executive Committee. "
"368","Pasadena","4096","3","2019","The Pasadena Area Consortium remains committed to providing lead programmatic, instructional opportunities that are designed to provided opportunities for adult learners to advance in current employment and/or to help them gain new skill sets to move into living waged employment. Across the past three years, the consortium has provided programs and services to our communities and we have recently undergone a period of assessment to refine and better determine the most strategically appropriate job sectors for continued and future activities. We maintain the the vision of engaging with businesses and advisory groups to align our collective endeavors with key, workforce sectors in which forecasted job opportunities remain high for the  future; most notably in the key sectors of Hospitality/Tourism, Pre-Apprenticeship Building and inspection, Health Care, and other key service-based industries sectors. 

Consortium members continue to work closely with business and industry advisory committees and other business partners to create more on-the-job internship opportunities for individuals. The path forward for adults to enter into and complete increased short-term workforce certificate program opportunities remains a lead outcome for the consortium members. Specific work with K-12 Outward Bound Adventures and other community based groups will be targeted towards future Workforce Skill Development for leading to in -demand, careers in environmental conservation.
Further, to meet the challenge of marketing to get the information to the community, specific CTE program brochures identifying training and educational opportunities have been developed and disseminated. Program opportunities are scheduled at various school sites throughout Pasadena area.


","Consortium members engaged in a day long retreat locally to review the progress of our efforts across the previous three-year planing cycle. The discussion details the identification of  areas of success, and areas low/no impact. The outcome of these activities were 1) to better identify and isolate the key business sectors in which the consortium will focus its workforce directives and activities and 2) to best align the member's strategic planning efforts such that we avoid duplication of efforts and provide positive impact on program completion, student transition on targeted pathways, and 3) successful job identification and placement. 

As the outcome of the planning retreat and other ongoing consortium member engagements, the resulting direction, planned strategies and activities for the members across the next three-year planning period strongly suggest that the PAC Consortium will achieve higher student enrollments, increased student completions, greater student navigation to pathway concretion, and ultimately increased job attainment and workforce success for students and business partners.  ","Any and all carry-over funds have been identified by consortium member(s) and folded into the planning for increased capacity building, staffing, implementation, and completion across activities for 2018-2019. These and other supportive activities will all be consistent with AEBG goals and directives.  Carry-over funding will be utilized to hire critical instructional and support staff into essential leadership positions towards realizing the outcome expectations sufficient and appropriate space for staff to provide work related consultative and job placement services and for additional classroom space for instruction and workforce training courses. 

Additionally,  the Los Angeles area has identified five areas of highest potential for employment in the country.  Of those five areas, the Pasadena Area Consortium ( PAC) will focus efforts in the areas of 
1) Hospitality, 2) Building Construction and 3) Health services. Of these key sectors, it is anticipated that building and construction will be a very successful area of engagement. A lead Building and Construction company has indicated the willingness to hire adults who are interested in construction and to assist in program training, in collaboration with the lead instructional faculty for the program. Carry-over funding will assist in supporting this collaboration to the benefit of our students.","During the previous thee year ""look back"", the consortium focused high emphasis on older adults and adult learners with disabilities, modular-based Basic Work force Preparation Certificate program curriculum, programs to support Immigrant, undocumented adult learners,  ultimately moving individuals closer to obtaining citizenship, and an increased engagement and partnering with specific growth business sector areas. 

Envisioning consortium activities for the next three year period of service, while there will remain a focused effort to continually serve adults in each of the aforementioned  areas, specific emphasis and strategies will be  focused on improving alignment of programmatic activities with the the needs of regional workforce development partners. In other words, the more specific program activities will be targeted towards developing and delivering needed, short-term workforce based instructional courses and programs.  The most significant and discernible difference in the consortium's efforts will be recognizable in those activities that identify and meet business needs and which move individuals into the workforce more quickly that is currently the case.

"340","Morongo Basin","4068","3","2019","The Morongo Basin Adult Education Consortium is composed of the one community college district (Copper Mountain Community College District) and the one K-12 school district (Morongo Unified School District) in the geographic boundaries of our consortium area. We utilize a collaborative approach that includes a Community Advisory Board, representing various nonprofit entities in our area that serve youth and adults through their public and social services agencies as well as educators from both the community college and school district. CMCCD and MUSD continue to have conversations about offering career pathways for both our recent high school graduates as well as older adults.  
","Moving forward, CMC will remain the fiscal agent, but MUSD will receive their full annual allocation, rather than ""billing"" CMC for each expenditure.  They will maintain a separate budget for their expenditures.  A significant portion of the funds allocated to CMC will go to MUSD for rental of a facility owned by MUSD (ACCE-East:  Academy of College and Career Excellence), located in 29 Palms as well as a separate facility rented by MUSD (ACCE-West), located in Yucca Valley (and with CMC having as a sub-lease to MUSD).  Students in our Adult High School Completion Program and our GED/HiSET Prep. Program will be able to work on their adult education requirements at any or all of these three sites.  In this way, we are providing services that are geographically convenient:  29 Palms (East), Joshua Tree (Central), and Yucca Valley (West).  In addition, MUSD is offering CTE programs for their K-12 students, but adults are offered any available seats in those programs.  This year, CMC is planning  short-term certificate programs and the curriculum will be going through the approval process, with the plan of offering these programs during the 2019-20 academic year at one of these three adult education sites.    ","Because  our process involves planning and implementation, the funds required for implementation are usually greater than is required for the planning process.  As has been the case most recently, it looked as if we didn't need our complete allocation because we had significant amounts rolled-over from one year to the next.  However, that was done purposefully because we knew that we would be needing a significant amount of funds for our purchase of two modular buildings for our expanding adult education program at the CMC main campus located in Joshua Tree.  In this current year, we do not have any carry-over from 2017-18, and we do not expect to have any 2018-19 funds that would carry-over to 2019-20.","MUSD closed one of its continuation schools a few years ago, but in January 2017, we reopened the school as AC2E—East: the Academy for College & Career Excellence, located in 29 Palms.  We used AEBG funding for cosmetic remodeling as well as technological infrastructure and the purchase of computers and smart board technology. In the 2017-18 year, we added face-to-face courses for each of the four subject areas of the GED, with a four hour class each day, Monday through Thursday.  In addition, the Consortium opened another Academy for College and Career Excellence, AC2E--West that is located in Yucca Valley.  

As indicated in last year's ""Annual Plan,"" we fulfilled our plan to use AEBG funding to purchase two modular buildings that serve as our new Student Success Center & our new ESL classroom for our main campus in Joshua Tree. We had literally exceeded our capacity at the main campus, even with the preparation classes being offered at AC2E.  We moved into our new building in November 2017.  Prior to the move, students often had to wait for a desk or a computer because all were being used. With the modular building for the SSC, we have more than doubled the number of computers available for students; we will have a private office for our noncredit counselor we hired last year as well as private offices for the Coordinator and the Grants Specialist.

With the larger ESL classroom, we continue to plan for an increase in our offerings, and the next fiscal year, we will be launching a new recruitment drive to make the community more aware of our ESL offerings. We also have been approved to be a HiSET testing site, and we are waiting for our approval to offer the GED test as well.  We will continue to develop our offerings in hospitality, tourism, and customer service, and we hope to have a short-term certificate program in place during the 2018-19 fiscal year.

MUSD has also developed new programs this year that are open to adult students if space is available; these are in addition to the Radiological Dental Assisting program that is available to adults if space is available.  At AC2E--West, these CTE programs include the following:  Physical Therapy Aide, Personal Fitness Trainer, and a Pharmacy Assistant.  At AC2E--East,  MUSD will be offering the following, beginning in Fall 2018:  Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (Drone) and Cyber Security I/II.  In Spring, MUSD will add 911 Operator and Private Security Guard programs."

Each year we continue expanding, exploring and implementing new ways to provide adult education and employment needs for adults from all walks of life. Members of the consortium through ongoing partnerships will continue to help adults improve literacy skills, complete their high school diploma or their recognized equivalents, complete post-secondary certificates, degrees or training programs, find employment, increase their wages, transition to post-secondary pathways and/or provide courses focused in helping parents, guardians and mentors offer children support and guidance in academic success. 
Goal completion is essential to our regional team because many adults start but don't finish for a variety of reasons.  
Through continued integrated academic programs, partnerships, increased communication, shared student data and referral information, expansion of support services and shared professional development, our consortia has already experienced adults completing goals and benefiting from AB104 performance outcomes.
Because the demands of ABE, CTE and ESL courses are high within our region, our consortium has primarily focused on solidifying current programs. This has proven to be successful. More than 50% of adults seeking ABE and CTE courses throughout our consortium successfully complete and obtain a high school diploma, equivalent and/or certificate. Depending on the goal of the adult, some may even transition from non-credit CTE classes to credit CTE courses through Shasta College. After completion at the community college, industry recognized certificates are attainable through credit bearing courses. Whether non-credit or credit, positive outcomes are met by helping adults enter employment and sometimes helping those currently employed receive wage increases. Partnerships have been made with local businesses through current AEBG CTE programs, creating long term partnerships and sustainability for the future workforce. 
Within the year an increase of English Language Learners have shown interest and dedication to their ESL classes. ESL classes have been expanded this year (Shasta and Tehama counties) because of the high percentage of ELL seeking ESL classes and continued expansion is needed within Trinity county possibly offered at the county office of education. 

","Annual 18/19PY allocation including COLA for our consortium aligns with specific areas included within the three year plan. 18/19 allocations will be used by members and service providers in one or more of these areas:

Professional development for continued learning and application of best practices modeled within California for adult education
Text material and instructional materials
Marketing
Childcare for areas with no other funding stream to cover costs of this barrier to education and employment for many adults
Testing fees (adult basic education GED, HS Diploma and HiSET)

Carry-over funds from FY18 will be distributed to members in a manner agreed and voted on by the consortium.  Member will agree to spend carry-over from the previous year completely in the current fiscal year.  All carry over will be used to enhance and/or increase services.

A planning committee is advised to help establish collaboration and consensus among all members of below goals. Planning meetings should start in early September, 2018 (8-9 month window), to strategically organize and discuss objectives below. Goals may be modified, added or deleted by committee before due date of 3-year plan.
1. Build teacher collaboration within K-12 districts and the community college for curriculum development and alignment. Collaboration and consensus will ensure developmental courses appropriately align with the subsequent course in the educational pathway. Alignments must take place across programs (from one segment to another) and within (non-credit to credit programs). Curriculum must also be fully integrated with career certificate programs and local employment needs. New courses should be developed where gaps are identified.  
2. Create student goal mapping tool through Better.Jobs website. 
3. Expand regional marketing (billboards, Spanish radio ads, local businesses, chamber of commerce, etc.).
4. Increase use of integrated regional student tracking tool-Community Pro (community referrals, assessments, case notes, student documents-transcripts, resumes, etc.).
5. Build partnerships with regional social support agencies not currently participating in AEBG (EDD/CalJobs, Colleague/Shasta College, DOR, Social Service, etc.).   
6. Incorporate the 21st Century curriculum regionally as a stand-alone course or incorporated into other course curriculum.
7. Expand distance education methods and non-credit programs in remote regional areas. 
8. Target adults supporting children in school who themselves need adult education assistance (ABE, Diploma completion, CTE, wage increase, etc.).
9. Connect with Basic Skills Initiative to increase student services and completion rates through supplemental instruction, embedded tutoring and direct learning activities.
10. Increase partnerships with high industry demand businesses for CTE needs (space, teachers, trainings, workshops, etc.).
11. Increase local business awareness of potential employee leads. Students successfully obtaining an industry related occupational skill(s) gain and CTE certificate of completion will be referred to local job center or business for employment opportunities.

The Regional Comprehensive Plan submitted in March 2015 serves as a foundational plan for the Consortium toward the realization of the vision and goals keeping in alignment with the county’s vision of working together to create regional stability among Adult Education providers.

BACAE is located in California’s High Desert, and covers mostly rural geography. The economic development plan of the county does not address the specific needs of the Consortium. With a renewed commitment to the AEBG initiative, the 2017-18 plan was developed to bring BACAE into alignment with AB104 legislation, and move the adult education programs in the region forward in a spirit of collaboration and partnership.

During the 2018-19 fiscal year, BACAE will primarily address gaps in service and seamless transitions. Additionally, the Consortium will deploy methods to support accelerated learning programs for students in their academic pathways and/or career goals. The Consortium will work on building relationships with more community partners to leverage existing resources. To address the needs of rural areas, BACAE will develop and implement a Distance Learning policy.

BACAE will offer professional development across the AEP Program Areas includes training on the CCR Standards, Andragogical Methodologies of Instruction, Technology in the Adult Education Classroom, and WIOA/AEP. Member Districts will encourage faculty and staff to attend regional, state and national conferences as a means of forming peer relations with other education professionals and developing professional teaching competencies.

All members will engage in renewed efforts to increase transitions between adult education programs and for successful transition to Barstow Community College. Lastly, BACAE Members will begin the process of WASC Accreditation as a precursor for applying for WIOA funds, in full recognition of the importance of braided/blended funding. While this might not be possible for every Member, the BACAE Board commits to exploring options to increase the rigor and credibility of all programs across the Consortium.","BACAE Board Members engage in ongoing data, program, and budget analysis to ensure continuous improvement among all Consortium Members and that decisions align to both the AEP Objectives and the AEP program areas, and to ensure that all funded initiatives align to the approved Three-Year Plan.","Barstow Unified School District, the former Fiscal Agent, will continue to manage the spend-down and budget expenditure reporting of: 
- 2016-17 AEP Allocations (due to expire on December 31, 2018) 
- Data & Accountability Fund (due to expire on December 31, 2018) 
- 2017-18 AEP Allocations (due to expire on December 31, 2019)

This includes the timely issuance of Purchase Orders and invoice payments, and meeting all legal requirements as a former Fiscal Agent as identified in AB104. ","BACAE Member Districts engage in ongoing analyses to identify gaps in services, and adjust programs accordingly at the Member level that support career and academic pathways leading to increased wages and/or transitions to postsecondary institutions. During the 2018-19 FY, BACAE will work with a consultant to analyze regional LMI data and identify long-term trends in high-growth sectors that will influence the planning at the Consortium level. Retreats with the working group, steering committee and executive board are being scheduled to collaboratively inform the development of the new Three-Year Plan. "
